            <p style="text-align: left;">At The <strong>Great Exhibition Road Festival</strong>, we had the chance to
                introduce <strong>synthetic
                    biology</strong>in a fun and
                informal way to young children, including kindergartners. To make molecular biology exciting and
                interactive, we teamed up with the <strong>Good Food Institute</strong> and co-organised a stall called
                <strong>Build a Microbial
                    Factory</strong>.
            </p>

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
                We also featured <strong>The Overlab</strong>, a fast-paced, multiplayer game strongly inspired by
                Overcooked, but set in
                a <strong>synthetic biology</strong> lab instead of a kitchen. In Overlab, players take on different lab
                roles to build
                synthetic biology experiments under time pressure, from preparing reagents to assembling plasmids to
                running protocols. Just like in a real lab, <strong>teamwork</strong> and <strong>communication</strong>
                are essential to success. The
                game was a fun way for the children to learn about lab workflows and teamwork in science, in a fun,
                chaotic environment.

            <p style="text-align: left;">We taught kids aged 3 to 7 how a <strong>yeast cell</strong> functions using a
                hands-on <strong>marble
                    game</strong> designed to simulate
                the journey of a molecule through a living cell. Children guided a marble which represents a protein or
                molecule, through a colourful, physical model of a yeast cell, passing through key organelles like the
                <strong>nucleus</strong>, <strong>endoplasmic reticulum</strong>,<strong>Golgi apparatus</strong>, and
                more. At each station, we explained what that part
                of the cell does in simple, relatable terms (like "<i>this is where the cell reads instructions!" or
                    "this
                    is the cell’s post office!</i>"). We turned complex molecular biology into an <strong>immersive
                    experience</strong>
                that kids
                could touch, see, and understand.

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">To make science feel <strong>less distant</strong> and more exciting for young
                children, our
                iGEM team created a <strong>colourful picture book</strong> that introduces the idea of “A Day in the
                Life of a
                Scientist”. The book was designed with <strong>simple language</strong> and <strong>bright
                    illustrations</strong> to show scientists not
                just as people in lab coats, but as curious <strong>problem-solvers</strong> who ask questions, explore
                the world, and
                try to make life better for everyone. We used the picture book during our nursery visits, where it
                helped <strong>spark conversations</strong> with children and gave them an <strong>early</strong>,
                <strong>positive impression</strong> of science.
                <br><br>
                During our nursery visits, the book was <strong>read aloud</strong> to groups of children, encouraging
                them to <strong>engage
                    with
                    the story</strong> by pointing out details in the illustrations and sharing their own thoughts about
                being future
                scientists. This <strong>interactive format</strong> helped spark curiosity and gave children an early,
                positive
                impression
                of science as something <strong>playful and accessible</strong>.

            <p style="text-align: left;">Synthetic biology and the greater STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
                Mathematics) field can be portrayed as too <strong>advanced</strong> or “grown-up,” leaving children
                <strong>out of the
                    conversation</strong> and its role in shaping the future. We wanted to change that for our project,
                by creating a
                resource that introduces key concepts in a way that feels <strong>familiar</strong>,
                <strong>playful</strong>, and <strong>accessible</strong> to young
                audiences.
            </p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design an <strong>educational</strong> colouring book
                filled with themed
                pages that invite children to “<i>meet the scientists</i>,” imagine themselves doing lab work, and
                explore
                the building blocks of life, such as cells, organs, and even synthetic meat as part of our project. Each
                page was designed with <strong>simple</strong>, <strong>bold outlines</strong> for colouring, paired
                with <strong>short</strong>, <strong>child-friendly
                    explanations</strong> that encourage curiosity and creativity.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">Through combining <strong>classic colouring activities</strong> with <strong>real
            scientific themes</strong>, the
        book makes synthetic biology <strong>approachable</strong> at an early age, showing that science isn’t just
        something
        hidden away in labs but part of <strong>everyday life</strong> and future possibilities. Beyond being fun, it
        serves as a
        <strong>gentle introduction</strong> to synthetic biology, planting the seeds of interest in STEM while also
        helping
        children and their families feel <strong>included</strong> in scientific conversations.
        <br> <br>
        Once complete, the colouring book was published online and presented in our visits to nurseries.

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">For children, science is usually taught and presented as something
                <strong>serious</strong> and
                <strong>complicated</strong>, rather than <strong>playful</strong> and <strong>imaginative</strong>. We
                wanted to <italic>challenge that perception</italic> by creating a
                resource that makes synthetic biology approachable through <strong>storytelling</strong>,
                <strong>humour</strong>, and <strong>relatable
                    characters</strong>.
            </p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design a <strong>digital Webtoon-style storybook</strong>,
                starring our
                mascot Sir Loin, and Dr. Pea Pod as they set off on adventures to explore and explain synthetic biology.
                Each episode introduces a new theme about <strong>sustainable food</strong> and <strong>synthetic
                    meat</strong>. By <strong>personifying
                    scientific ideas</strong> through characters, we aimed to <strong>break down barriers</strong> and
                make abstract concepts <strong>easier
                    to grasp</strong>.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">The <strong>comic format</strong> allowed us to merge <strong>entertainment
                    with education</strong>, capturing
                the imagination of younger audiences while also engaging older readers who might be curious but
                intimidated by technical language. <strong>Bright artwork</strong> and <strong>approachable
                    narratives</strong> turned synthetic biology
                into a <strong>story-driven experience</strong> rather than a lecture, showing that science can be both
                <strong>fun and relevant</strong>.

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">For our <strong>kindergarten outreach efforts,</strong> we realised that
                showcasing
                <strong>cultivated meat</strong> to kids can sound very scary, especially to picky eaters. To combat
                this issue, we
                wanted to create a <strong>mascot</strong> that made our project <strong>approachable, fun, and
                    memorable</strong>. This led to
                the creation of <strong>Sir Loin</strong>: our mascot cartoon steak with a monocle, moustache, and top
                hat, the face
                of Growf when talking to children.
                <br><br>
                To bring him to life, we designed a <strong>do-it-yourself plushie kit</strong> complete with a steak
                plush base,
                adhesive felt for facial features, a mini top hat, and templates to guide assembly. The kit was
                <strong>more
                    than an arts and crafts project</strong>. It invited children to engage with our projects tough
                SynBio concepts
                through <strong>hands-on creativity</strong>, turning an abstract concept like cultivated meat into
                something
                <strong>tangible and playful</strong>.
                <br><br>
                Shared online and at outreach events, the plushie served as both a <strong>science communication
                    tool</strong> and an
                <strong>icebreaker</strong>, helping younger audiences warm up to conversations about the future of
                food.

            <p style="text-align: left;">For many people, no matter their age or stage in education, entering the field
                of <strong>synthetic biology</strong> can feel <strong>confusing</strong> and
                <strong>overwhelming</strong>. Since it is still an <strong>up-and-coming</strong> area in the
                big field of biology, the opportunities, especially in the UK, are numbered.
            </p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">We wanted to make this journey <strong>clearer</strong> by creating a
                <strong>career guide</strong> that
                introduces the best <strong>degrees</strong> to pursue for a future in SynBio, along with the wide range
                of possible
                <strong>career paths</strong> that follow, with emphasis on <strong>academia and industry</strong> to
                startups and <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>.
            </p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Drawing on our own <strong>team composition</strong> and experiences during
                <strong>iGEM</strong>, we highlighted
                the degrees that provide <strong>strong foundations</strong> for synthetic biology, including
                <strong>life sciences</strong>, <strong>engineering</strong>,
                and <strong>computational disciplines</strong>. For careers, we researched companies and organisations
                we interacted with
                during the project, as well as <strong>leading players</strong> we knew in the field, to showcase the
                <strong>diversity of
                    opportunities available</strong>.
            </p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Importantly, we also included our own <strong>honest reflections</strong> and
                <strong>advice</strong> to make the
                guide friendly and encouraging.
            </p>


        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="spacer2"></div>

    <p style="text-align: left;"> Once completed, we shared the career guide on our <strong>Slack community</strong> and
        distributed
        it directly to <strong>high
            school students</strong> through their outreach channels, helping prospective SynBio enthusiasts at
        different
        stages feel more <strong>confident</strong> about their next steps.</p>

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">We understand that our field, synthetic biology, is often described as a “<italic>niche
                within a niche</italic>”. With that comes a lot of <strong>specialised</strong> and <strong>technical jargon</strong> that can make the field feel
                <strong>inaccessible</strong> to newcomers and the general public. To make our project and synthetic biology more
                <strong>approachable</strong>, we created a <strong>visual dictionary</strong> that defines commonly used terms, both from our work and
                the broader field. The aim was to <strong>break down complex concepts</strong> into simple, easy-to-understand language.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">The glossary includes terms like <i>gene regulation</i>,<i>cultivated meat</i>,
                <i>transcription factor</i>. These and many more are presented with <strong>clear</strong>, <strong>beginner-friendly</strong> <strong>definitions</strong>
                and
                <strong>bold</strong>, <strong>eye-catching visuals</strong> to make complex biology feel approachable and engaging for all audiences.
                <br><br>
                It’s a resource we hope can help <strong>students</strong>, <strong>educators</strong>, and the <strong>general</strong> <strong>public</strong> feel more confident
                navigating this exciting area of science.

            <p style="text-align: left;">As part of our education efforts, we had the opportunity to connect with the
                <strong>Hiroo Gakuen</strong> (HG) team from <strong>Japan</strong>. This conversation was a unique chance to share both <strong>scientific
                knowledge</strong> and <strong>iGEM experience</strong> with younger students who are just starting to explore <strong>synthetic biology</strong>.
            </p>

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">This interview was especially meaningful for us because it aligned directly
                with our <strong>high school education strategy</strong>. By speaking to motivated high school students, we could
                highlight not only <strong>synthetic biology</strong> concepts but also the broader opportunities iGEM provides for
                <strong>teamwork</strong>, <strong>creativity</strong>, and <strong>learning beyond the classroom</strong>.</p>

            <div class="spacer2"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Through this exchange, we aimed to <strong>demystify iGEM</strong> for high school students
                while raising awareness about <strong>synthetic biology applications</strong> in the real world. It was both an
                <strong>educational dialogue</strong> and a moment of <strong>mentorship</strong>, bridging our role as “senior” iGEMers with the <strong>next
                generation</strong> of synthetic biologists.</p>

        <div class="column-right">

            <p style="text-align: left;">This year, our Imperial iGEM team led the Digital Postcard Initiative, a global
                collaboration connecting iGEM teams from every continent (including high school and university groups).
                The goal? To share not just projects, but experiences, journeys, and knowledge.</p>


            <p style="text-align: left;">Each team created a digital postcard with artwork and a letter introducing
                themselves, their university, and their project in simple, accessible language. This allowed
                participants to learn from each other, celebrate diverse approaches, and see how synthetic biology is
                tackled in labs across the world.</p>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p style="text-align:left;">But the impact didn’t stop there. All postcards were made publicly available,
                turning them into
                “<i>synthetic biology love letters.</i>” Each message communicated a team’s passion for synthetic
                biology and
                shared it with the wider public in an engaging, friendly way.</p>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p style="text-align:left;">Readers can explore projects from around the globe, see where teams are
                based, and learn about the
                science behind their work. By encouraging teams to explain their projects simply, we made cutting-edge
                synthetic biology approachable for everyone, not just scientists.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">This mix was intentional, we wanted students to see that synthetic biology
                can
                lead to innovations in diverse fields. While also raising important ethical questions. The variety
                of
                topics also helped students connect synthetic biology to their own interests, whether they were
                studying
                biology, computer science, chemistry, or philosophy. By showcasing both the exciting potential and
                the
                complex responsibilities that come with engineering life, we aimed to challenge narrow views of the
                field and spark curiosity across disciplines. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="column-right">

            <p style="text-align: left;">We wanted to show university students just how broad and exciting synthetic
                biology can be, something that often isn’t highlighted in UK academic settings. Our goal was to show
                students that synthetic biology isn’t just one thing, that can be applied across countless fields,
                from
                health to technology to design. To do this, we collaborated with the <i>Frontiers in Scientific
                    Research
                    Summit</i>, a student-led synthetic biology conference. We hosted a special section featuring
                five
                short
                crash-course talks on diverse topics: <i>DNA-based computing and data storage, synthetic perfumery,
                    engineered red blood cells, somatic cell genome editing, and Risks, biosecurity and bioethics
                </i>.
            </p>

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;"> We got many questions during each of the talks, and the sessions often
                turned
                into open discussions, with students sharing their own thoughts and asking how to explore certain
                topics
                further. Several attendees approached us after the talks to continue the conversation, and we were
                able
                to provide additional resources and answer follow-up questions. It was clear that the diversity of
                the
                topics sparked genuine curiosity and two-way engagement throughout the session.</p>

    <div class="two-column-container">

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">We saw a clear gap in the UK for students interested in synthetic biology,
                unlike more established fields like clinical research or law, there was no central space for early
                synthetic biologists to connect, collaborate, and grow. To change this, we launched the UK SynBio
                Circle, a dedicated UK-regional Slack community, designed specifically for university students and
                early-career researchers in the field. </p>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p style="text-align: left;">We carefully structured it around the journey of someone entering and
                growing
                in the field. We created specific channels for sharing research papers, troubleshooting lab
                techniques,
                and discussing current developments in synthetic biology. There’s a space for conferences and
                events,
                where members can share upcoming talks, workshops, and funding opportunities. Our #opportunities
                channel
                became a hub for internships, PhD openings, start-up positions, and collaboration requests, and has
                been
                used by several companies to reach talent directly. We also included casual and social channels to
                help
                people meet informally, share ideas, and feel part of a broader, supportive community.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p style="text-align: left;">The Slack gained traction quickly, over 150 students from more than 12
                universities across the UK joining. Alongside professionals from five start-ups who shared jobs and
                internships, such as SynX Therapeutics. It’s become an active space where students can find each
                other,
                exchange ideas, and take their first steps into the field with a network behind them.

    <div class="two-column-container">

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">Synthetic biology is often seen as abstract and highly technical by the
                general
                public, while researchers can be reluctant to hold open conversations with the public to hear out
                their
                concerns. We wanted to change that by creating a resource that felt familiar and accessible, while
                still
                delivering serious ideas</p>

            <div class="spacer2"></div>

        </div>

        <div class="column-right">

            <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design an educational magazine inspired by the 2000s
                teen
                tabloids many people grew up with, complete with bold layouts, quizzes, horoscopes, and playful
                commentary. We selected synbio stories that connect directly to people's everyday lives and are
                often
                discussed negatively, such as cultivated meat and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). We paired
                these
                with topics typically limited to scientific circles, like lab dress codes or microbial chassis
                selection, all presented in a playful, accessible format. To add another layer of interactivity, we
                included simple mini-experiments that readers could try at home with common household items,
                demonstrating basic scientific principles in a fun, accessible way. </p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Drawing directly from the formatting of glossy magazines, we recreated the
                experience of flipping through a pop-culture tabloid, but instead of celebrity gossip, readers
                discovered stories about biotechnology. Once complete, the magazine was shared online on our social
                media channels like Instagram and Slack, and sent to Imperial’s Department of Bioengineering for
                outreach printing, where it now serves as a fun entry point for prospective students. </p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">In doing so, we provided an unusual but effective way to make synthetic
                biology
                approachable, showing that even complex science can be communicated with humour, nostalgia, and
                creativity.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">This year, with iGEM participation among UK teams dropping to just four teams from
        20
        back in 2016, we recognised the importance of strengthening connections across the regional SynBio
        community. To
        address this, we focused our outreach on building the UK SynBio Network by engaging directly with university
        societies during their Fresher’s Fairs.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p style="text-align: left;">We reached out to synthetic biology student societies across the UK through email,
        Instagram DMs, and LinkedIn, successfully establishing collaborations with 9 external societies, plus our
        own
        Imperial SynBio Society, bringing the total to 10. </p>

    <div class="spacer2"></div>

    <p style="text-align: left;">Synthetic biology gives us the power to design life, but also the
        responsibility to reflect on its ethical and societal impacts. These conversations are still emerging
        within the field, and often overlooked in scientific training. As an iGEM team, we wanted to help shift
        that narrative.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p style="text-align: left;">To do this, we created an in-depth essay exploring key philosophical ideas
        relevant to synthetic biology. Our goal was to make complex ethical concepts accessible and to show how
        they apply directly to real-world biotechnology. The essay introduces major ethical frameworks like
        utilitarianism and deontology, as well as modern perspectives such as posthumanism. We explored
        influential thinkers, including Immanuel Kant, Michel Foucault, and Donna Haraway, and connected their
        work to current debates in science, from lab-grown meat and GMOs to synthetic organisms and biosecurity.
    </p>


    <p style="text-align: left;">To bring these ideas to life, we also included classic thought experiments like
        the <i>Ship of Theseus</i> and the <i>Frankenstein Dilemma</i>, using them to challenge assumptions
        about identity,
        responsibility, and the boundaries between nature and technology. Throughout the essay, we grounded the
        discussion in both our own iGEM project and broader societal examples, aiming to make philosophy
        relevant to young scientists and synthetic biologists.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p style="text-align: left;">Since its release, the essay has been shared across other iGEM teams and
        university communities. It helped spark meaningful conversations within our own team, shaping how we
        approached safety, design, and public engagement. This project reminded us that ethics and philosophy
        shouldn’t be a “second thought”. As synthetic biology advances, so must our thinking about what it means
        to engineer life, and how we can do so with humility and responsibility.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">In the UK, iGEM teams have no formal opportunities to practice for the Grand
        Jamboree or connect with each other outside their universities, so we set out to create a national Mini
        Jamboree. Our aim was to give student teams a platform to rehearse their presentations, showcase
        synthetic biology innovation to undergraduates considering joining future teams, and connect students
        directly with researchers, industry professionals, and alumni. To prepare ourselves, we developed a
        15-minute project talk and practiced it over two weeks, ensuring we could present our best work to the
        crowd and fellow iGEM teams.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p style="text-align: left;">As organisers, we needed to secure speakers, booths, a venue, funding, and
        volunteers,
        while
        also designing interactive elements such as live Q&As and question submission forms. We reached out to over
        30
        companies to bring in leading voices from the synbio community, booked one of Imperial’s most prestigious
        lecture theatres, and held one-to-one preparation meetings with every speaker. The final line-up featured
        some
        of the UK’s most exciting startups and researchers: David Kim of CyanoCapture and Shan Jiang, iGEM alumnus
        and
        founder of Ailurus Bio, delivered keynotes; Kärt Tomberg of ExpressionEdits joined us for an interactive
        fireside chat using a new live Q&A platform; Martin Carballo Pacheco represented Hoxton Farms with a
        workshop on
        cultivated meat technology; and our Future of Biotech panel showcased the journeys of FullCircleLabs, Change
        Bio, and Amytis, three early-stage startups using AI and automation to transform biotechnology.</p>

    <div class="spacer2"></div>

    <div class="two-column-container">

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">Beyond the programme itself, our team designed the agenda, accessibility
                guides, and infographic content for guests, coordinated volunteers through a dedicated application
                process, and kept up daily social media updates leading up to the date to build anticipation. During
                the
                event, we ran student team presentations with live Q&As from alumni and industry professionals,
                filmed
                short videos during breaks to capture instant feedback, and ensured every session encouraged
                audience
                interaction.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">The event drew over <b>60</b> engaged attendees and received outstanding
                feedback: our
                survey reported average satisfaction scores of 4.73/5 for speaker selection and 4.82/5 for resources
                and
                communication, with 91% of respondents saying they would return next year. One participant
                reflected,
                “The Future of Biotech panel was very candid. The panelists were super warm and helpful when

    <p style="text-align: left;">Overall, the Mini Jamboree was a vibrant success. For iGEM teams, it provided
        invaluable practice before Paris; for the broader audience, it was an inspiring showcase of what
        synthetic biology can achieve when students, academics, and entrepreneurs come together — and proof that
        it is never too early to start building in synthetic biology.</p>

    <div class="spacer2"></div>

    <p style="text-align: left;">To better understand how cultural background influences trust in synthetic
        biology, our team worked with iGEM Yale and MIT-MAHE to design a collaborative survey. Each team
        proposed five questions during a joint call, which we refined into a final survey distributed for one
        week. The survey attracted a predominantly young audience, most between the ages of 18–25, with varying
        levels of familiarity with synthetic biology.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Results showed that while medicine was the best-known
                application, food and agriculture sparked the strongest opinions: over half of respondents were willing
                to try synbio-based foods, though many expressed safety concerns. Responses clustered into four broad
                groups—pro/accepting, hesitant, anti, and neutral—with reasoning ranging from climate and nutritional
                benefits to distrust and health risks. More broadly, most participants believed the benefits of
                synthetic biology outweigh its risks, and many reported increased trust in science compared to previous
                years, though some remained skeptical due to political influence, misinformation, or corporate control.
                <br><br>
                A strong majority also valued public involvement in decision-making about the field,
                highlighting the
                importance of transparent and inclusive dialogue in shaping future acceptance.

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">Once we closed our survey, and collated our results, we collaborated with the
                Yale and
                MIT-MAHE iGEM teams on a two-hour webinar to explore how cultural background shapes trust in scientific
                innovation, an angle often hinted at in surveys but rarely examined in depth. There, we showcased our
                analysed
                responses, and produced infographics. </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">The MIT-MAHE Team recalled how in India, trust is measured in relation to
                how
                biotechnology directly affects daily life, such as how local farmers interact with GM crops.
                However, the Yale
                Team described that in the United States, people tend to see genetic modification as part of
                everyday life,
                normalised through large-scale commercial agriculture where distinctions between GM and non-GM
                products are less
                relevant.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"> The two-hour conversation was both a platform to exchange perspectives on
                the survey and an opportunity to practice our presentation skills across continents. We had a long
                conversation
                about how different factors influence trust in science, the strongest contrasts being from cultural
                and
                legislative environments. </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;"> In contrast, we highlighted how in Europe, bans and restrictions confine genetic
        engineering largely
        to academia and the pharmaceutical sector, shaping a more cautious public perception, and less public trust in
        genetic modification. Despite these differences, a unifying theme emerged: younger generations across regions
        displayed a notably positive outlook on synthetic biology, suggesting that they will play a key role in shaping
        broader acceptance of the field in the future.</p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">Did you know that over half of adults regularly listen to podcasts, often
        using
        them to learn something new while going about their day? We thought: why not bring synthetic biology
        to
        this growing medium? With this in mind, we launched a podcast aimed at reaching the general public
        in a
        lighthearted, accessible way.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>







    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p style="text-align: left;">Hosted by two of our team members, each episode features interviews with different
        iGEM
        members discussing a topic in synthetic biology that they are passionate about. Guests also share their
        journey
        into synthetic biology and iGEM, providing insight into how others can get involved, whether at high school,
        undergraduate, or postgraduate levels.
        <br><br>
        This approach makes the podcast both educational and inspiring, covering not only the science behind
        synthetic
        biology but also personal stories and experiences.
        Our episodes have explored a wide range of topics, including the fundamentals of synthetic biology,
        biomanufacturing and its scaling challenges, GMOs, biological pattern formation, and women in biotech
        entrepreneurship.
        <br><br>
        We’ve also welcomed guest iGEM teams, such as the Manipal team from India, to share their experiences and
        perspectives. This has made the podcast a platform for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and discussion
        across
        teams, generations, and audiences.
        <br><br>
        In addition to the discussions, we’ve incorporated creativity and music into the project. One team member,
        combining their passion for synthetic biology and music, produced a unique podcast jingle using lab sounds
        and
        instruments creating a “magical lab” vibe that reflects the sci-fi and innovative spirit of our field.
        <br><br>
        Overall, the podcast has become an innovative educational tool that transcends traditional media and
        demographics. It’s a fun, accessible way for the public to learn about synthetic biology while highlighting
        the
        collaborative and creative culture of iGEM.

    <div id="bioethics-quiz" class="tagline-subline" style="text-align: left;"><span>Bioethics Quiz</span></div>

    <div class="spacer2"></div>

    <div class="two-column-container">

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">As part of our public education strategy, we wanted a way to make people
                reflect on bioethics in an accessible, on-the-go format. Quizzes are something we all enjoy: on the
                bus,
                at home, or shared with friends. Instead of “<i>Which character are you?</i>”, our quiz asks: What
                do
                your
                choices reveal about ethics in the age of synthetic biology?
                <br><br>
                That idea became The Moral Code: an immersive quiz that reimagines the classic “<i>Trolley
                    Problem</i>”
                for
                today’s scientific frontiers.
            </p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                The Moral Code takes players through five ethical worlds, each tied to a framework that guides
                decisions
                in science. Early choices feel simple, but later dilemmas demand real moral trade-offs.
            </p>

    <div class="spacer2"></div>

    <p style="text-align: left;"> You’ll face <strong>crisis responses in The Outbreak</strong> (utilitarianism),
        <strong>risk-versus-innovation in The Green
            Lab</strong> (precautionary principle), <strong>questions of fairness in The Divide</strong> (justice &
        equity), <strong>personal
            rights in The Trial</strong> (autonomy & consent), and finally <strong>enhancement in The Horizon
            Project</strong>
        (posthumanism).
        <br><br>
        Every choice is tracked across four axes: <strong>Idealism, Realism, Rebellion,</strong> and
        <strong>Skepticism,</strong> which
        reveal your archetype: <strong>The Idealist, The Realist, The Rebel,</strong> or <strong>The
            Skeptic.</strong>
        In rare cases, when
        answers deeply contradict, the system overrides and gives <strong>The Mirror,</strong> reflecting back inner
        conflict
        instead of a score.
        <br><br>
        To intensify the journey, the game also delivers <strong>thought interruptions,</strong> sudden prompts that
        stop the
        story and force you to justify a choice, like: "<i>You chose to silence a community for the greater good.
            How do you justify that?</i>" These moments turn abstract dilemmas into personal reflection.
        <br><br>
        The Moral Code does not tell players what is right or wrong. Instead, it highlights how advances in
        synthetic
        biology make old ethical debates urgent again. By playing, participants see how their values influence
        decisions
        about risk, fairness, and identity.

        This makes bioethics tangible and personal, showing that science is never just technical, it is also social
        and
        moral.
        <br><br>
        As biotechnology grows more powerful, society faces choices that affect everyone. Should we enhance human
        traits? Release engineered microbes? Who gets access first?

        Through this quiz, we invite the public to reflect on these questions in a simple, playful way. Our hope is
        to
        spark dialogue, critical thinking, and awareness about the futures synthetic biology could create.
