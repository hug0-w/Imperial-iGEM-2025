    <div class="two-column-container">

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">At The Great Exhibition Road Festival, we had the chance to introduce synthetic
                biology in a fun and
                informal way to young children, including kindergartners. To make molecular biology exciting and
                interactive, we teamed up with the Good Food Institute and co-organised a stall called Build a Microbial
                Factory.</p>

            <div class="spacer3"></div>

            <div class="image-aligner-left">

            </div>

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
                We also featured The Overlab, a fast-paced, multiplayer game strongly inspired by Overcooked, but set in
                a synthetic biology lab instead of a kitchen. In Overlab, players take on different lab roles to build
                synthetic biology experiments under time pressure, from preparing reagents to assembling plasmids to
                running protocols. Just like in a real lab, teamwork and communication are essential to success. The
                game was a fun way for the children to learn about lab workflows and teamwork in science, in a fun,
                chaotic environment.

            <p style="text-align: left;">We taught kids aged 3 to 7 how a yeast cell functions using a hands-on marble
                game designed to simulate
                the journey of a molecule through a living cell. Children guided a marble which represents a protein or
                molecule, through a colourful, physical model of a yeast cell, passing through key organelles like the
                nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and more. At each station, we explained what that part
                of the cell does in simple, relatable terms (like "<i>this is where the cell reads instructions!" or
                    "this
                    is the cell’s post office!</i>"). We turned complex molecular biology into an immersive experience
                that kids
                could touch, see, and understand. </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Throughout the day, we welcomed 167 student players and received great feedback
                from both kids and parents about how much they enjoyed the experience.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Synthetic biology and the greater STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
                Mathematics) field can be portrayed as too advanced or “grown-up,” leaving children out of the
                conversation and its role in shaping the future. We wanted to change that for our project, by creating a
                resource that introduces key concepts in a way that feels familiar, playful, and accessible to young
                audiences.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design an educational colouring book filled with themed
                pages that invite children to “<i>meet the scientists</i>,” imagine themselves doing lab work, and
                explore
                the building blocks of life, such as cells, organs, and even synthetic meat as part of our project. Each
                page was designed with simple, bold outlines for colouring, paired with short, child-friendly
                explanations that encourage curiosity and creativity.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Through combining classic colouring activities with real scientific themes, the
                book makes synthetic biology approachable at an early age, showing that science isn’t just something
                hidden away in labs but part of everyday life and future possibilities. Beyond being fun, it serves as a
                gentle introduction to synthetic biology, planting the seeds of interest in STEM while also helping
                children and their families feel included in scientific conversations.
                <br> <br>
                Once complete, the colouring book was published online and presented in our visits to nurseries.
