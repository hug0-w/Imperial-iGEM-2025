    <p style="text-align: left;">We believe <strong>education</strong> is more than communication—it's about creating
        <strong>connections</strong>, fostering <strong>curiosity</strong>, and giving people the tools to engage
        <strong>critically</strong> with <strong>science</strong>.
        Our education strategy was aimed at <strong>four distinct audiences</strong>—<strong>kindergarten</strong>,
        <strong>high school</strong>,
        <strong>university</strong>, and the <strong>general public</strong>. At every step, our work was
        <strong>reviewed and validated by
            professionals in synthetic biology and sustainable food systems</strong>, ensuring that our materials were
        both
        <strong>accurate</strong> and <strong>impactful</strong>. We tailored our approaches to match the needs of each
        group, while drawing on
        expert guidance to make sure our work stood out as <strong>rigorous, creative, and reliable</strong>.

        We developed <strong>interactive tools</strong>, <strong>narrative formats</strong>, and <strong>inclusive
            events</strong>, always paired with <strong>real
            feedback</strong>—both from audiences and from <strong>leaders in the field</strong>. This dual validation
        meant we could be
        confident our resources were not just engaging, but also <strong>informative</strong>, <strong>useful</strong>,
        and <strong>professionally
            endorsed</strong>.

            <p style="text-align: left;">From the very first spark of curiosity in young children, we wanted science to
                feel <strong>vibrant</strong>, <strong>playful</strong>, and <strong>inclusive</strong>. In our
                <strong>Kindergarten outreach</strong>, we created
                <strong>interactive</strong>, <strong>colourful</strong> experiences that invited children to imagine
                themselves as
                <strong>scientists</strong>, exploring, experimenting, and asking questions. All the
                <strong>nurseries</strong> we visited
                embraced the approach, using and sharing our materials with their children, giving us direct feedback
                that shaped how we presented concepts.
                <br><br>
                Importantly, the <strong>cultivated meat aspects</strong> of our coloring book and activities were
                <strong>reviewed by a
                    regional Good Food Institute representative</strong> and a <strong>Bezos Centre for Sustainable
                    Protein research
                    associate</strong>, who confirmed that our content was both <strong>scientifically accurate</strong>
                and
                <strong>age-appropriate</strong>. This gave us confidence that even our simplest activities were rooted
                in
                professional knowledge, while still sparking <strong>wonder and curiosity</strong>.

                <p style="text-align: left;">At The <strong>Great Exhibition Road Festival</strong>, we had the chance
                    to
                    introduce <strong>synthetic
                        biology</strong>in a fun and
                    informal way to young children, including kindergartners. To make molecular biology exciting and
                    interactive, we teamed up with the <strong>Good Food Institute</strong> and co-organised a stall
                    called
                    <strong>Build a Microbial
                        Factory</strong>.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    We also featured <strong>The Overlab</strong>, a fast-paced, multiplayer game strongly inspired by
                    Overcooked, but set in
                    a <strong>synthetic biology</strong> lab instead of a kitchen. In Overlab, players take on different
                    lab
                    roles to build
                    synthetic biology experiments under time pressure, from preparing reagents to assembling plasmids to
                    running protocols. Just like in a real lab, <strong>teamwork</strong> and
                    <strong>communication</strong>
                    are essential to success. The
                    game was a fun way for the children to learn about lab workflows and teamwork in science, in a fun,
                    chaotic environment.

                <p style="text-align: left;">We taught kids aged 3 to 7 how a <strong>yeast cell</strong> functions
                    using a
                    hands-on <strong>marble
                        game</strong> designed to simulate
                    the journey of a molecule through a living cell. Children guided a marble which represents a protein
                    or
                    molecule, through a colourful, physical model of a yeast cell, passing through key organelles like
                    the
                    <strong>nucleus</strong>, <strong>endoplasmic reticulum</strong>,<strong>Golgi apparatus</strong>,
                    and
                    more. At each station, we explained what that part
                    of the cell does in simple, relatable terms (like "<i>this is where the cell reads instructions!" or
                        "this
                        is the cell’s post office!</i>"). We turned complex molecular biology into an <strong>immersive
                        experience</strong>
                    that kids
                    could touch, see, and understand.

                <p style="text-align: left;">To make science feel <strong>less distant</strong> and more exciting for
                    young
                    children, our
                    iGEM team created a <strong>colourful picture book</strong> that introduces the idea of “A Day in
                    the
                    Life of a
                    Scientist”. The book was designed with <strong>simple language</strong> and <strong>bright
                        illustrations</strong> to show scientists not
                    just as people in lab coats, but as curious <strong>problem-solvers</strong> who ask questions,
                    explore
                    the world, and
                    try to make life better for everyone. We used the picture book during our nursery visits, where it
                    helped <strong>spark conversations</strong> with children and gave them an <strong>early</strong>,
                    <strong>positive impression</strong> of science.
                    <br><br>
                    During our nursery visits, the book was <strong>read aloud</strong> to groups of children,
                    encouraging
                    them to <strong>engage
                        with
                        the story</strong> by pointing out details in the illustrations and sharing their own thoughts
                    about
                    being future
                    scientists. This <strong>interactive format</strong> helped spark curiosity and gave children an
                    early,
                    positive
                    impression

                    and
                    Mathematics) field can be portrayed as too <strong>advanced</strong> or “grown-up,” leaving children
                    <strong>out of the
                        conversation</strong> and its role in shaping the future. We wanted to change that for our
                    project,
                    by creating a
                    resource that introduces key concepts in a way that feels <strong>familiar</strong>,

                <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design an <strong>educational</strong> colouring book
                    filled with themed
                    pages that invite children to “<i>meet the scientists</i>,” imagine themselves doing lab work, and
                    explore
                    the building blocks of life, such as cells, organs, and even synthetic meat as part of our project.
                    Each
                    page was designed with <strong>simple</strong>, <strong>bold outlines</strong> for colouring, paired
                    with <strong>short</strong>, <strong>child-friendly

            book makes synthetic biology <strong>approachable</strong> at an early age, showing that science isn’t just
            something
            hidden away in labs but part of <strong>everyday life</strong> and future possibilities. Beyond being fun,
            it
            serves as a
            <strong>gentle introduction</strong> to synthetic biology, planting the seeds of interest in STEM while also
            helping
            children and their families feel <strong>included</strong> in scientific conversations.
            <br> <br>
            Once complete, the colouring book was published online and presented in our visits to nurseries.

                    mascot Sir Loin, and Dr. Pea Pod as they set off on adventures to explore and explain synthetic
                    biology.
                    Each episode introduces a new theme about <strong>sustainable food</strong> and <strong>synthetic
                        meat</strong>. By <strong>personifying
                        scientific ideas</strong> through characters, we aimed to <strong>break down barriers</strong>
                    and
                    make abstract concepts <strong>easier
                        to grasp</strong>.</p>

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">The <strong>comic format</strong> allowed us to merge <strong>entertainment
                        with education</strong>, capturing
                    the imagination of younger audiences while also engaging older readers who might be curious but
                    intimidated by technical language. <strong>Bright artwork</strong> and <strong>approachable
                        narratives</strong> turned synthetic biology
                    into a <strong>story-driven experience</strong> rather than a lecture, showing that science can be
                    both
                    <strong>fun and relevant</strong>.

                <p style="text-align: left;">For our <strong>kindergarten outreach efforts,</strong> we realised that
                    showcasing
                    <strong>cultivated meat</strong> to kids can sound very scary, especially to picky eaters. To combat
                    this issue, we
                    wanted to create a <strong>mascot</strong> that made our project <strong>approachable, fun, and
                        memorable</strong>. This led to
                    the creation of <strong>Sir Loin</strong>: our mascot cartoon steak with a monocle, moustache, and
                    top
                    hat, the face
                    of Growf when talking to children.
                    <br><br>
                    To bring him to life, we designed a <strong>do-it-yourself plushie kit</strong> complete with a
                    steak
                    plush base,
                    adhesive felt for facial features, a mini top hat, and templates to guide assembly. The kit was
                    <strong>more
                        than an arts and crafts project</strong>. It invited children to engage with our projects tough
                    SynBio concepts
                    through <strong>hands-on creativity</strong>, turning an abstract concept like cultivated meat into
                    something
                    <strong>tangible and playful</strong>.
                    <br><br>
                    Shared online and at outreach events, the plushie served as both a <strong>science communication
                        tool</strong> and an
                    <strong>icebreaker</strong>, helping younger audiences warm up to conversations about the future of
                    food.

                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>High school</strong> is a moment when <strong>curiosity</strong>
                    first becomes
                    <strong>action</strong>: "Who
                    do I want to be? Where might I go next?" Many students interested in <strong>STEM</strong> lack
                    <strong>exposure</strong> to
                    synthetic biology and often don't even know the field <strong>exists</strong>. Our approach centred
                    on
                    <strong>clarity</strong> and <strong>access</strong>. We produced <strong>resources</strong> to
                    demystify the field and help students
                    <strong>critically assess</strong> whether it might be for them.
                    <br><br>
                    Our work was strengthened by the support of <strong>Imperial College Outreach</strong>, who guided
                    us in
                    restructuring our <strong>magazine</strong> for clarity and relevance. Beyond that, our materials
                    were also
                    <strong>endorsed by Prof. Tom Ellis</strong>, co-director of the UK Centre for Synthetic Biology,
                    who approved
                    our approach to introducing synthetic biology and cultivated meat to high schoolers. His validation
                    was crucial: it meant our resources were not only creative but also <strong>professionally relevant
                        and
                        meaningful</strong>.

                <p style="text-align: left;">For many people, no matter their age or stage in education, entering the
                    field
                    of <strong>synthetic biology</strong> can feel <strong>confusing</strong> and
                    <strong>overwhelming</strong>. Since it is still an <strong>up-and-coming</strong> area in the
                    big field of biology, the opportunities, especially in the UK, are numbered.

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">We wanted to make this journey <strong>clearer</strong> by creating a
                    <strong>career guide</strong> that
                    introduces the best <strong>degrees</strong> to pursue for a future in SynBio, along with the wide
                    range

                    <strong>career paths</strong> that follow, with emphasis on <strong>academia and industry</strong>

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">Drawing on our own <strong>team composition</strong> and experiences during
                    <strong>iGEM</strong>, we highlighted
                    the degrees that provide <strong>strong foundations</strong> for synthetic biology, including
                    <strong>life sciences</strong>, <strong>engineering</strong>,
                    and <strong>computational disciplines</strong>. For careers, we researched companies and
                    organisations
                    we interacted with
                    during the project, as well as <strong>leading players</strong> we knew in the field, to showcase
                    the
                    <strong>diversity of

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">Importantly, we also included our own <strong>honest reflections</strong>
                    and
                    <strong>advice</strong> to make the
                    guide friendly and encouraging.

            and
            distributed
            it directly to <strong>high
                school students</strong> through their outreach channels, helping prospective SynBio enthusiasts at

                    <strong>technical jargon</strong> that can make the field feel

                    used terms, both from our work and
                    the broader field. The aim was to <strong>break down complex concepts</strong> into simple,
                    easy-to-understand language.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: left;">The glossary includes terms like <i>gene regulation</i>,<i>cultivated
                        meat</i>,
                    <i>transcription factor</i>. These and many more are presented with <strong>clear</strong>,
                    <strong>beginner-friendly</strong> <strong>definitions</strong>
                    and
                    <strong>bold</strong>, <strong>eye-catching visuals</strong> to make complex biology feel
                    approachable
                    and engaging for all audiences.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s a resource we hope can help <strong>students</strong>, <strong>educators</strong>, and the
                    <strong>general</strong> <strong>public</strong> feel more confident
                    navigating this exciting area of science.

                <p style="text-align: left;">As part of our education efforts, we had the opportunity to connect with
                    the
                    <strong>Hiroo Gakuen</strong> (HG) team from <strong>Japan</strong>. This conversation was a unique
                    chance to share both <strong>scientific
                        knowledge</strong> and <strong>iGEM experience</strong> with younger students who are just
                    starting
                    to explore <strong>synthetic biology</strong>.

                <div class="spacer5"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">This interview was especially meaningful for us because it aligned directly
                    with our <strong>high school education strategy</strong>. By speaking to motivated high school
                    students,
                    we could
                    highlight not only <strong>synthetic biology</strong> concepts but also the broader opportunities
                    iGEM
                    provides for
                    <strong>teamwork</strong>, <strong>creativity</strong>, and <strong>learning beyond the

                <div class="spacer2"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">Through this exchange, we aimed to <strong>demystify iGEM</strong> for high
                    school students
                    while raising awareness about <strong>synthetic biology applications</strong> in the real world. It
                    was
                    both an
                    <strong>educational dialogue</strong> and a moment of <strong>mentorship</strong>, bridging our role
                    as
                    “senior” iGEMers with the <strong>next
                        generation</strong> of synthetic biologists.

            <div class="column-right">

                <p style="text-align: left;">This year, our Imperial iGEM team led the <strong>Digital Postcard
                        Initiative</strong>, a <strong>global
                        collaboration</strong> connecting iGEM teams from <strong>every continent</strong> (including
                    high
                    school and university groups).
                    The goal? <strong>To share not just projects</strong>, but <strong>experiences</strong>,
                    <strong>journeys</strong>, and <strong>knowledge</strong>.
                </p>


                <p style="text-align: left;">Each team created a <strong>digital postcard</strong> with artwork and a
                    letter
                    introducing
                    themselves, their university, and their project in <strong>simple, accessible language</strong>.
                    This
                    allowed
                    participants to <strong>learn from each other</strong>, celebrate diverse approaches, and see how
                    <strong>synthetic biology</strong> is
                    tackled in labs across <strong>the world</strong>.
                </p>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                <p style="text-align:left;">But the impact didn’t stop there. All postcards were made <strong>publicly
                        available</strong>,
                    turning them into
                    “<i>synthetic biology love letters.</i>” Each message communicated a team’s passion for synthetic
                    biology and
                    shared it with the <strong>wider public</strong> in an <strong>engaging</strong>,
                    <strong>friendly</strong> way.
                </p>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                <p style="text-align:left;">Readers can <strong>explore projects from around the globe</strong>, see
                    where
                    teams are
                    based, and learn about the
                    <strong>science behind their work</strong>. By encouraging teams to explain <strong>their projects
                        simply</strong>, we made <strong>cutting-edge</strong>
                    <strong>synthetic biology approachable</strong> for everyone, not just scientists.

            <strong>between iGEM teams</strong>, and
            second, <strong>learning opportunities for the general public</strong>. It’s a celebration of

                    <strong>realism</strong>, and <strong>community</strong>. Our

                    disciplines. With the support of <strong>Imperial Outreach (university branch)</strong> and the
                    <strong>UK
                        Synthetic Biology Centre</strong>, we extended our reach beyond academia, bringing students into

                    <br><br>
                    This strategy, too, was <strong>validated by Prof. Tom Ellis</strong>, who approved our methods and

                <p style="text-align: left;">This mix was <strong>intentional</strong>, we wanted students to see that
                    synthetic biology
                    can
                    lead to innovations in <strong>diverse fields</strong>. While also raising <strong>important ethical
                        questions</strong>. The variety
                    of
                    topics also helped students <strong>connect</strong> synthetic biology to their own interests,
                    whether
                    they were
                    studying
                    biology, computer science, chemistry, or philosophy. By showcasing both the <strong>exciting

                    the
                    <strong>complex responsibilities</strong> that come with engineering life, we aimed to challenge
                    narrow

                    turned
                    into <strong>open discussions</strong>, with students sharing their own thoughts and asking how to

                    topics
                    further. Several attendees approached us <strong>after the talks</strong> to continue the
                    conversation,
                    and we were
                    able
                    to provide additional resources and answer follow-up questions. It was clear that the diversity of
                    the
                    topics sparked <strong>genuine</strong> curiosity and <strong>two-way engagement</strong> throughout
                    the
                    session.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;">We wanted to show university students just how <strong>broad and
                        exciting</strong> synthetic
                    biology can be, something that often isn’t highlighted in UK academic settings. Our goal was to show
                    students that synthetic biology isn’t just <strong>one thing</strong>, that can be applied across
                    <strong>countless fields</strong>,
                    from
                    health to technology to design. To do this, we collaborated with the <i>Frontiers in Scientific
                        Research
                        Summit</i>, a student-led synthetic biology conference. We hosted a special section featuring
                    <strong>five
                        short
                        crash-course talks</strong> on diverse topics: <i>DNA-based computing and data storage,
                        synthetic
                        perfumery,
                        engineered red blood cells, somatic cell genome editing, and Risks, biosecurity and bioethics
                    </i>.

                <p style="text-align: left;">We saw a clear gap in the UK for students interested in synthetic biology,
                    <strong> unlike more established fields</strong> like clinical research or law, there was <strong>no
                        central space</strong> for early
                    synthetic biologists to connect, collaborate, and grow. To change this, we launched the <strong>UK
                        SynBio
                        Circle</strong>, a dedicated UK-regional Slack community, designed specifically for university
                    students and
                    early-career researchers in the field.
                </p>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                <p style="text-align: left;">We carefully structured it around the <strong>journey of someone entering
                        and
                        growing
                        in the field</strong>. We created <strong>specific channels</strong> for sharing research
                    papers,
                    troubleshooting lab
                    techniques,
                    and discussing current developments in synthetic biology. There’s a space for <strong>conferences
                        and
                        events</strong>,
                    where members can share upcoming talks, workshops, and funding opportunities. Our #opportunities
                    channel
                    became a <strong>hub for internships, PhD openings, start-up positions, and collaboration
                        requests</strong>, and has
                    been
                    used by several companies to reach talent directly. We also included casual and social channels to
                    help
                    people meet informally, share ideas, and feel part of a <strong>broader, supportive
                        community</strong>.

                <p style="text-align: left;">The Slack gained traction quickly, <strong>over 150 students</strong> from
                    more
                    than 12
                    universities across the UK joining. Alongside professionals from <strong>five start-ups</strong> who
                    shared jobs and
                    internships, such as <italic>SynX Therapeutics</italic>. It’s become an <strong>active

                    where students can find each
                    other,

            <div class="column-left">

                <p style="text-align: left;">Synthetic biology is often seen as <strong>abstract and highly
                        technical</strong> by the
                    general
                    public, while researchers can be <strong>reluctant to hold open conversations</strong> with the
                    public
                    to hear out
                    their
                    concerns. We wanted to change that by creating a resource that felt <strong>familiar and
                        accessible</strong>, while
                    still
                    delivering serious ideas</p>

            </div>

            <div class="column-right">

                <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design an educational magazine inspired by the
                    <strong>2000s
                        teen
                        tabloids</strong> many people grew up with, complete with <strong>bold layouts</strong>,
                    <strong>quizzes</strong>, <strong>horoscopes</strong>, and <strong>playful
                        commentary</strong>. We selected synbio stories that connect <strong>directly to people's
                        everyday
                        lives</strong> and are
                    often
                    discussed negatively, such as cultivated meat and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). We paired
                    these
                    with topics typically limited to <strong>scientific circles</strong>, like lab dress codes or
                    microbial
                    chassis
                    selection, all presented in a <strong>playful, accessible format</strong>. To add another layer of
                    interactivity, we
                    included <strong>simple mini-experiments</strong> that readers could try at home with common
                    household
                    items,
                    demonstrating basic scientific principles in a fun, accessible way.
                </p>

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">Drawing directly from the formatting of <strong>glossy magazines</strong>,
                    we
                    recreated the
                    experience of flipping through a pop-culture tabloid, but instead of celebrity gossip, readers
                    discovered stories about <strong>biotechnology</strong>. Once complete, the magazine was shared
                    online
                    on our social
                    media channels like Instagram and Slack, and sent to Imperial’s Department of Bioengineering for
                    outreach printing, where it now serves as a <strong>fun entry point</strong> for prospective
                    students.
                </p>

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">In doing so, we provided an <strong>unusual but effective way</strong> to
                    make
                    synthetic
                    biology
                    approachable, showing that even complex science can be communicated with <strong>humour</strong>,
                    <strong>nostalgia</strong>, and
                    <strong>creativity</strong>.

                <p style="text-align: left;">This year, with iGEM participation among UK teams dropping to just
                    <strong>four
                        teams</strong>
                    from
                    <strong>20</strong>
                    back in 2016, we recognised the importance of <strong>strengthening connections</strong> across the
                    regional SynBio
                    community. To
                    address this, we focused our outreach on <strong>building the UK SynBio Network</strong> by engaging
                    directly with
                    university
                    societies during their Fresher’s Fairs.

                        <li style="color: #000000; text-align: left;"><strong>Remote collaboration</strong>, we supplied
                            outreach materials
                            that societies could present at their stalls, ensuring they could still be part of the

        <p style="text-align: left;">Through this effort, we not only <strong>showcased synthetic biology and
                iGEM</strong>
            to new students
            across the country but also laid the foundations for a <strong>stronger, more connected UK SynBio
                community</strong>. The
            partnerships created through this outreach highlighted <strong>cross-university collaboration</strong> in
            sustaining enthusiasm
            for synthetic biology despite reduced iGEM participation.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;">For the <strong>general public</strong>, our aim was not to "explain
                    science," but to
                    <strong>invite people into the debate</strong>. We designed activities that encouraged people to
                    think about the
                    role biotechnology already plays in their lives — from what's on their plate to how future medicine
                    might be designed — and to consider both its <strong>opportunities</strong> and

                    <br><br>
                    Our podcast and events in this area were directly inspired by and supported by <strong>Prof. Tom
                        Ellis</strong>,
                    who not only approved the concept but also <strong>suggested formats and tools</strong> that shaped
                    its
                    development. He encouraged us to use podcasts as a way to make synthetic biology both
                    <strong>accessible</strong>
                    and <strong>conversational</strong>, and his early input directly influenced our content choices.
                    The <strong>Synthetic
                        Biology Society</strong> also supported our outreach, amplifying our reach across student and

                    Feedback from participants confirmed that they left with a new perspective and felt more confident

                <p style="text-align: left;">Synthetic biology gives us the <strong>power to design life</strong>, but
                    also
                    the
                    <strong>responsibility</strong> to reflect on its ethical and societal impacts. These conversations
                    are
                    still <strong>emerging</strong>
                    within the field, and often overlooked in scientific training. As an iGEM team, we wanted to help
                    <strong>shift
                        that narrative</strong>.
                </p>

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">To do this, we created an <strong>in-depth essay</strong> exploring key
                    philosophical ideas
                    relevant to synthetic biology. Our goal was to make complex ethical concepts accessible and to show
                    how
                    they apply directly to <strong>real-world biotechnology</strong>. The essay introduces major ethical
                    frameworks like
                    utilitarianism and deontology, as well as modern perspectives such as posthumanism. We explored
                    influential thinkers, including Immanuel Kant, Michel Foucault, and Donna Haraway, and connected
                    their
                    work to current debates in science, from lab-grown meat and GMOs to synthetic organisms and
                    biosecurity.
                </p>


                <p style="text-align: left;">To bring these ideas to life, we also included classic thought experiments
                    like
                    the <i>Ship of Theseus</i> and the <i>Frankenstein Dilemma</i>, using them to challenge assumptions
                    about <strong>identity</strong>,
                    <strong>responsibility</strong>, and the <strong>boundaries between nature and technology</strong>.
                    Throughout the essay, we grounded the
                    discussion in both our own iGEM project and broader societal examples, aiming to make philosophy
                    <strong>relevant</strong> to young scientists and synthetic biologists.
                </p>

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">Since its release, the essay has been shared across other iGEM teams and
                    university communities. It helped spark <strong>meaningful</strong> conversations within our own
                    team,
                    shaping how we
                    approached safety, design, and public engagement. This project reminded us that ethics and
                    philosophy
                    shouldn’t be a “second thought”. As synthetic biology advances, so must our thinking about
                    <strong>what
                        it means
                        to engineer life</strong>, and how we can do so with <strong>humility and
                        responsibility</strong>.

        <p style="text-align: left;">In the UK, <strong>iGEM teams have no formal opportunities</strong> to practice for
            the
            Grand
            Jamboree or connect with each other outside their universities, so we set out to create a <strong>national
                Mini
                Jamboree</strong>. Our aim was to give student teams a platform to <strong>rehearse their
                presentations</strong>, <strong>showcase
                synthetic biology</strong> innovation to undergraduates considering joining future teams, and
            <strong>connect students
                directly with researchers</strong>, <strong>industry professionals</strong>, and
            <strong>alumni</strong>. To
            prepare ourselves, we developed a
            <strong> 15-minute project talk</strong> and practiced it over two weeks, ensuring we could present our best
            work to the
            crowd and fellow iGEM teams.

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">As organisers, we needed to secure <strong>speakers</strong>,
            <strong>booths</strong>,
            <strong>a venue</strong>, <strong>funding</strong>, and
            <strong>volunteers</strong>,
            while
            also designing interactive elements such as <strong>live Q&As</strong> and <strong>question submission
                forms</strong>. We reached out to over
            <strong> 30+
                companies</strong> to bring in leading voices from the synbio community, booked one of Imperial’s
            <strong>most prestigious
                lecture theatres</strong>, and held <strong>one-to-one preparation meetings</strong> with every speaker.
            The
            final line-up featured
            some
            of the UK’s most exciting startups and researchers: <strong>David Kim</strong> of
            <strong>CyanoCapture</strong>
            and<strong> Shan Jiang</strong>, iGEM alumnus
            and
            founder of <strong>Ailurus Bio</strong>, delivered keynotes; <strong>Kärt Tomberg</strong> of
            <strong>ExpressionEdits</strong> joined us for an <strong>interactive
                fireside chat</strong> using a new live Q&A platform; <strong>Martin Carballo Pacheco</strong>
            represented
            <strong>Hoxton Farms</strong> with a
            workshop on
            <strong>cultivated meat technology</strong>; and our Future of Biotech panel showcased the journeys of
            <strong>FullCircleLabs</strong>, <strong>Change
                Bio</strong>, and <strong>Amytis</strong>, three early-stage startups using <strong>AI and

            <div class="column-left">

                <p style="text-align: left;">Beyond the programme itself, our team designed the <strong>agenda</strong>,
                    <strong>accessibility
                        guides</strong>, and <strong>infographic content </strong>for guests, coordinated volunteers
                    through
                    a dedicated <strong>application
                        process</strong>, and kept up <strong>daily social media updates </strong>leading up to the date
                    to
                    build anticipation. During
                    the
                    event, we ran student team presentations with <strong>live Q&As</strong> from alumni and industry
                    professionals,
                    <strong>filmed
                        short videos</strong> during breaks to capture instant feedback, and ensured every session
                    encouraged
                    <strong>audience
                        interaction</strong>.

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">The event drew over <strong>60+ engaged attendees</strong> and received
                    outstanding
                    feedback: our
                    survey reported average satisfaction scores of <strong>4.73/5</strong> for speaker selection and
                    <strong>4.82/5</strong> for resources
                    and
                    communication, with <strong>91%</strong> of respondents saying they would return next year. One
                    participant
                    reflected,
                    “The Future of Biotech panel was very candid. The panelists were super warm and helpful when
                    answering

        <p style="text-align: left;">Overall, the Mini Jamboree was a <strong>vibrant success</strong>. For iGEM teams,
            it
            provided
            <strong>invaluable practice before Paris</strong>; for the broader audience, it was an inspiring showcase of
            what
            synthetic biology can achieve when students, academics, and entrepreneurs come together — and proof that
            it is <strong>never too early to start building in synthetic biology</strong>.

            <strong>trust

            proposed five questions during a joint call, which we refined into a final survey distributed for one
            week. The survey attracted a <strong>predominantly young audience</strong>, most between the ages of 18–25,
            with
            <strong>varying
                levels of familiarity</strong> with synthetic biology.

                    Results showed that while <strong>medicine</strong> was the best-known
                    application, <strong>food and agriculture</strong> sparked the <strong>strongest opinions</strong>:
                    over
                    half of respondents were willing
                    to try synbio-based foods, though many expressed safety concerns. Responses clustered into

                        broad
                        groups</strong>—pro/accepting, hesitant, anti, and neutral—with reasoning ranging from climate
                    and
                    nutritional
                    benefits to distrust and health risks. More broadly, most participants believed the <strong>benefits
                        of

                    <strong>Yale</strong> and

                    showcased our
                    analysed
                    responses, and produced infographics.

                <p style="text-align: left;">The MIT-MAHE Team recalled how in <strong>India</strong>, trust is measured
                    in
                    relation to
                    how
                    biotechnology <strong>directly affects daily life</strong>, such as how local farmers interact with
                    GM
                    crops.
                    However, the Yale
                    Team described that in the <strong>United States</strong>, people tend to see genetic modification
                    as
                    <strong>part of
                        everyday life</strong>,
                    normalised through large-scale commercial agriculture where distinctions between GM and non-GM
                    products are less
                    relevant.

                <p style="text-align: left;"> The two-hour conversation was both a platform to <strong>exchange
                        perspectives</strong> on
                    the survey and an opportunity to <strong>practice our presentation skills</strong> across
                    continents. We
                    had a long
                    conversation
                    about how different factors influence trust in science, the strongest contrasts being from
                    <strong>cultural
                        and
                        legislative environments</strong>.

        <p style="text-align: left;"> In contrast, we highlighted how in <strong>Europe</strong>, bans and restrictions
            confine genetic
            engineering largely
            to <strong>academia and the pharmaceutical sector</strong>, shaping a more cautious public perception, and
            less
            public trust in
            genetic modification. Despite these differences, a unifying theme emerged: <strong>younger generations
                across
                regions
                displayed a notably positive outlook</strong> on synthetic biology, suggesting that they will play a key
            role in shaping
            broader acceptance of the field in the future.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Did you know that over half of adults <strong>regularly listen to
                podcasts</strong>,
            often
            using
            them to learn something new <strong>while going about their day</strong>?<strong> We thought</strong>: why
            not
            bring synthetic biology
            to
            this <strong>growing medium</strong>? <strong>With this in mind</strong>, we <strong>launched</strong> a
            <strong>podcast aimed at reaching</strong> the general public
            in a
            <strong>lighthearted</strong>, <strong>accessible</strong> way.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>







        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Hosted by two of our team members</strong>, each episode features
            interviews
            with different
            <strong>iGEM</strong>
            members discussing a topic in synthetic biology that they are passionate about. <strong>Guests also share
                their
                journey</strong>
            into synthetic biology and iGEM, providing insight into how others can get involved, whether at high school,
            undergraduate, or postgraduate levels.
            <br><br>
            This approach makes the podcast both <strong>educational and inspiring</strong>, covering not only the
            science
            behind
            synthetic
            biology but also personal stories and experiences.
            Our episodes have explored a wide range of topics, including the <strong>fundamentals of synthetic
                biology</strong>,
            <strong>biomanufacturing</strong> and its <strong>scaling challenges</strong>, <strong>GMOs</strong>,
            <strong>biological pattern formation</strong>, and<strong> women in biotech</strong>
            <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>.
            <br><br>
            We’ve also welcomed guest iGEM teams, such as the Manipal team from India, to share their experiences and
            perspectives. This has made the podcast a platform for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and discussion
            across
            teams, generations, and audiences.
            <br><br>
            In addition to the discussions, we’ve <strong>incorporated creativity and music</strong> into the project.
            One
            team member,
            combining their passion for synthetic biology and music, produced a unique <strong>podcast jingle</strong>
            using
            lab sounds
            and
            instruments creating a “<strong>magical lab</strong>” vibe that reflects the sci-fi and innovative spirit of
            our
            field.
            <br><br>

        </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Listener feedback reflects the podcast’s ability to <strong>engage</strong>
            audiences
            from different
            backgrounds:</p>

                        really glad I clicked on it on my way to work. Now I can actually join in when people talk about
                        GMOs at dinner.</i>”</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">
                <blockquote>“<i>I’ve been trying to get into biotech entrepreneurship and have been consuming all sorts
                        of
                        content, but this episode was different. It felt honest, not overhyped, and really
                        down-to-earth.</i>”</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">
                <blockquote>“<i>What I love about this podcast is it makes you think about Synthetic Biology outside the
                        lab. It’s not just experiments or companies, it’s ethics, society, futuristic possibilities. I
                        always end up thinking about stuff I wouldn’t have considered before, which is super cool.</i>”
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Overall, the podcast has become an <strong>innovative educational</strong> tool
            that
            transcends
            traditional media and
            demographics. It’s a <strong>fun</strong>, <strong>accessible</strong> way for the public to learn about
            synthetic biology while highlighting the
            <strong>collaborative</strong> and <strong>creative</strong> culture of iGEM.

                <p style="text-align: left;">As part of our public education strategy, we wanted a way to make people
                    reflect on bioethics in an accessible, on-the-go format. Quizzes are something we all enjoy: on the
                    bus,
                    at home, or shared with friends. Instead of “<i>Which character are you?</i>”, our quiz asks: What
                    do
                    your
                    choices reveal about ethics in the age of synthetic biology?
                    <br><br>
                    That idea became The Moral Code: an immersive quiz that reimagines the classic “<i>Trolley

                    The Moral Code takes players through five ethical worlds, each tied to a framework that guides
                    decisions
                    in science. Early choices feel simple, but later dilemmas demand real moral trade-offs.

        <p style="text-align: left;"> You’ll face <strong>crisis responses in The Outbreak</strong> (utilitarianism),
            <strong>risk-versus-innovation in The Green
                Lab</strong> (precautionary principle), <strong>questions of fairness in The Divide</strong> (justice &
            equity), <strong>personal
                rights in The Trial</strong> (autonomy & consent), and finally <strong>enhancement in The Horizon
                Project</strong>
            (posthumanism).
            <br><br>
            Every choice is tracked across four axes: <strong>Idealism, Realism, Rebellion,</strong> and
            <strong>Skepticism,</strong> which
            reveal your archetype: <strong>The Idealist, The Realist, The Rebel,</strong> or <strong>The
                Skeptic.</strong>
            In rare cases, when
            answers deeply contradict, the system overrides and gives <strong>The Mirror,</strong> reflecting back inner
            conflict
            instead of a score.
            <br><br>
            To intensify the journey, the game also delivers <strong>thought interruptions,</strong> sudden prompts that
            stop the
            story and force you to justify a choice, like: "<i>You chose to silence a community for the greater good.
                How do you justify that?</i>" These moments turn abstract dilemmas into personal reflection.
            <br><br>
            The Moral Code does not tell players what is right or wrong. Instead, it highlights how advances in
            synthetic
            biology make old ethical debates urgent again. By playing, participants see how their values influence
            decisions
            about risk, fairness, and identity.

            This makes bioethics tangible and personal, showing that science is never just technical, it is also social
            and
            moral.
            <br><br>
            As biotechnology grows more powerful, society faces choices that affect everyone. Should we enhance human
            traits? Release engineered microbes? Who gets access first?

            Through this quiz, we invite the public to reflect on these questions in a simple, playful way. Our hope is
            to
            spark dialogue, critical thinking, and awareness about the futures synthetic biology could create.

        Beyond digital media, we reached around <strong>80 children</strong> through nursery visits,
        <strong>250+</strong> people via our
        <strong>bioethics quiz</strong>, and <strong>hundreds</strong> more through shared resources and events.
        <br><br>
        Together, these efforts show how combining <strong>digital</strong> and <strong>in-person</strong> outreach
        can engage <strong>diverse
            audiences</strong>—scientific and non-scientific, local and international—and highlight the potential
        for future
        iGEM teams to expand the <strong>reach</strong> of <strong>synthetic biology education</strong>.
