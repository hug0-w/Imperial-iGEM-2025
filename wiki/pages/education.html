    <div class="two-column-container">

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">At The Great Exhibition Road Festival, we had the chance to introduce synthetic
                biology in a fun and
                informal way to young children, including kindergartners. To make molecular biology exciting and
                interactive, we teamed up with the Good Food Institute and co-organised a stall called Build a Microbial
                Factory.</p>

            <div class="spacer3"></div>

            <div class="image-aligner-left">

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
                We also featured The Overlab, a fast-paced, multiplayer game strongly inspired by Overcooked, but set in
                a synthetic biology lab instead of a kitchen. In Overlab, players take on different lab roles to build
                synthetic biology experiments under time pressure, from preparing reagents to assembling plasmids to
                running protocols. Just like in a real lab, teamwork and communication are essential to success. The
                game was a fun way for the children to learn about lab workflows and teamwork in science, in a fun,
                chaotic environment.

            <p style="text-align: left;">We taught kids aged 3 to 7 how a yeast cell functions using a hands-on marble
                game designed to simulate
                the journey of a molecule through a living cell. Children guided a marble which represents a protein or
                molecule, through a colourful, physical model of a yeast cell, passing through key organelles like the
                nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and more. At each station, we explained what that part
                of the cell does in simple, relatable terms (like "<i>this is where the cell reads instructions!" or
                    "this
                    is the cell’s post office!</i>"). We turned complex molecular biology into an immersive experience
                that kids
                could touch, see, and understand. </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Synthetic biology and the greater STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
                Mathematics) field can be portrayed as too advanced or “grown-up,” leaving children out of the
                conversation and its role in shaping the future. We wanted to change that for our project, by creating a
                resource that introduces key concepts in a way that feels familiar, playful, and accessible to young
                audiences.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design an educational colouring book filled with themed
                pages that invite children to “<i>meet the scientists</i>,” imagine themselves doing lab work, and
                explore
                the building blocks of life, such as cells, organs, and even synthetic meat as part of our project. Each
                page was designed with simple, bold outlines for colouring, paired with short, child-friendly
                explanations that encourage curiosity and creativity.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Through combining classic colouring activities with real scientific themes, the
                book makes synthetic biology approachable at an early age, showing that science isn’t just something
                hidden away in labs but part of everyday life and future possibilities. Beyond being fun, it serves as a
                gentle introduction to synthetic biology, planting the seeds of interest in STEM while also helping
                children and their families feel included in scientific conversations.
                <br> <br>
                Once complete, the colouring book was published online and presented in our visits to nurseries.

    <div class="tagline-subline" style="text-align: left;"><span>Webtoon Science Storybook</span></div>

    <div class="spacer3"></div>

    <div class="two-column-container">

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">For children, science is usually taught and presented as something serious and
                complicated, rather than playful and imaginative. We wanted to challenge that perception by creating a
                resource that makes synthetic biology approachable through storytelling, humour, and relatable
                characters.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design a digital Webtoon-style storybook, starring our
                mascot Sir Loin, and Dr. Pea Pod as they set off on adventures to explore and explain synthetic biology.
                Each episode introduces a new theme about sustainable food and synthetic meat. By personifying
                scientific ideas through characters, we aimed to break down barriers and make abstract concepts easier
                to grasp.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">The comic format allowed us to merge entertainment with education, capturing
                the imagination of younger audiences while also engaging older readers who might be curious but
                intimidated by technical language. Bright artwork and approachable narratives turned synthetic biology
                into a story-driven experience rather than a lecture, showing that science can be both fun and relevant.

            <p style="text-align: left;">For many people, no matter their age or stage in education, entering the field
                of synthetic biology can feel confusing and overwhelming. Since it is still an up-and-coming area in the
                big field of biology, the opportunities, especially in the UK, are numbered.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">We wanted to make this journey clearer by creating a career guide that
                introduces the best degrees to pursue for a future in SynBio, along with the wide range of possible
                career paths that follow, with emphasis on academia and industry to startups and entrepreneurship. </p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Drawing on our own team composition and experiences during iGEM, we highlighted
                the degrees that provide strong foundations for synthetic biology, including life sciences, engineering,
                and computational disciplines. For careers, we researched companies and organisations we interacted with
                during the project, as well as leading players we knew in the field, to showcase the diversity of
                opportunities available. </p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Importantly, we also included our own honest reflections and advice to make the
                guide friendly and encouraging.
                <br><br>
                Once completed, we shared the career guide on our Slack community and distributed it directly to high
                school students through their outreach channels, helping prospective SynBio enthusiasts at different
                stages feel more confident about their next steps.

            <p style="text-align: left;">We understand that our field, synthetic biology, is often described as a “niche
                within a niche”. With that comes a lot of specialised and technical jargon that can make the field feel
                inaccessible to newcomers and the general public. To make our project and synthetic biology more
                approachable, we created a visual dictionary that defines commonly used terms, both from our work and
                the broader field. The aim was to break down complex concepts into simple, easy-to-understand language.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">The glossary includes terms like *gene regulation*, *cultivated meat*,
                *transcription factor.* These and many more are presented with clear, beginner-friendly definitions and
                bold, eye-catching visuals to make complex biology feel approachable and engaging for all audiences.
                <br><br>
                It’s a resource we hope can help students, educators, and the general public feel more confident
                navigating this exciting area of science.

            <p style="text-align: left;">As part of our education efforts, we had the opportunity to connect with the
                Hiroo Gakuen (HG) team from Japan. This conversation was a unique chance to share both scientific
                knowledge and iGEM experience with younger students who are just starting to explore synthetic biology.
            </p>

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">This interview was especially meaningful for us because it aligned directly
                with our high school education strategy. By speaking to motivated high school students, we could
                highlight not only synthetic biology concepts but also the broader opportunities iGEM provides for
                teamwork, creativity, and learning beyond the classroom.</p>

            <div class="spacer3"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Through this exchange, we aimed to demystify iGEM for high school students
                while raising awareness about synthetic biology applications in the real world. It was both an
                educational dialogue and a moment of mentorship, bridging our role as “senior” iGEMers with the next
                generation of synthetic biologists.</p>

                iGEM, what it is like to balance lab work with university studies, and how to navigate the challenges of
                building a project from scratch.</p>

                the hurdles of finding lab space, and the importance of communication and team morale. At the same time,
                we offered advice tailored to younger iGEMers, from practical tips on balancing schoolwork with
                deadlines to encouragement for overcoming the initial challenges of starting a project.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="column-right">

            <p style="text-align: left;">This year, our Imperial iGEM team led the Digital Postcard Initiative, a global
                collaboration connecting iGEM teams from every continent (including high school and university groups).
                The goal? To share not just projects, but experiences, journeys, and knowledge.</p>


            <p style="text-align: left;">Each team created a digital postcard with artwork and a letter introducing
                themselves, their university, and their project in simple, accessible language. This allowed
                participants to learn from each other, celebrate diverse approaches, and see how synthetic biology is
                tackled in labs across the world.</p>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p style="text-align:left;">But the impact didn’t stop there. All postcards were made publicly available,
                turning them into
                “<i>synthetic biology love letters.</i>” Each message communicated a team’s passion for synthetic
                biology and
                shared it with the wider public in an engaging, friendly way.</p>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p style="text-align:left;">Readers can explore projects from around the globe, see where teams are
                based, and learn about the
                science behind their work. By encouraging teams to explain their projects simply, we made cutting-edge
                synthetic biology approachable for everyone, not just scientists.</p>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p style="text-align:left;">This initiative created double-layered education: first, knowledge exchange
                between iGEM teams, and
                second, learning opportunities for the general public. It’s a celebration of collaboration, curiosity,
                and the global community united by a shared passion for synthetic biology.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">This mix was intentional, we wanted students to see that synthetic biology can
                lead to innovations in diverse fields. While also raising important ethical questions. The variety of
                topics also helped students connect synthetic biology to their own interests, whether they were studying
                biology, computer science, chemistry, or philosophy. By showcasing both the exciting potential and the
                complex responsibilities that come with engineering life, we aimed to challenge narrow views of the
                field and spark curiosity across disciplines. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="column-right">

            <p style="text-align: left;">We wanted to show university students just how broad and exciting synthetic
                biology can be, something that often isn’t highlighted in UK academic settings. Our goal was to show
                students that synthetic biology isn’t just one thing, that can be applied across countless fields, from
                health to technology to design. To do this, we collaborated with the <i>Frontiers in Scientific Research
                    Summit</i>, a student-led synthetic biology conference. We hosted a special section featuring five
                short
                crash-course talks on diverse topics: <i>DNA-based computing and data storage, synthetic perfumery,
                    engineered red blood cells, somatic cell genome editing, and Risks, biosecurity and bioethics </i>.
            </p>

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;"> We got many questions during each of the talks, and the sessions often turned
                into open discussions, with students sharing their own thoughts and asking how to explore certain topics
                further. Several attendees approached us after the talks to continue the conversation, and we were able
                to provide additional resources and answer follow-up questions. It was clear that the diversity of the
                topics sparked genuine curiosity and two-way engagement throughout the session.</p>

    <div class="two-column-container">

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">We saw a clear gap in the UK for students interested in synthetic biology,
                unlike more established fields like clinical research or law, there was no central space for early
                synthetic biologists to connect, collaborate, and grow. To change this, we launched the UK SynBio
                Circle, a dedicated UK-regional Slack community, designed specifically for university students and
                early-career researchers in the field. </p>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p style="text-align: left;">We carefully structured it around the journey of someone entering and growing
                in the field. We created specific channels for sharing research papers, troubleshooting lab techniques,
                and discussing current developments in synthetic biology. There’s a space for conferences and events,
                where members can share upcoming talks, workshops, and funding opportunities. Our #opportunities channel
                became a hub for internships, PhD openings, start-up positions, and collaboration requests, and has been
                used by several companies to reach talent directly. We also included casual and social channels to help
                people meet informally, share ideas, and feel part of a broader, supportive community.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p style="text-align: left;">The Slack gained traction quickly, over 150 students from more than 12
                universities across the UK joining. Alongside professionals from five start-ups who shared jobs and
                internships, such as SynX Therapeutics. It’s become an active space where students can find each other,
                exchange ideas, and take their first steps into the field with a network behind them.
