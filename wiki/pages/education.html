    <div class="two-column-container">

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">At The Great Exhibition Road Festival, we had the chance to introduce synthetic
                biology in a fun and
                informal way to young children, including kindergartners. To make molecular biology exciting and
                interactive, we teamed up with the Good Food Institute and co-organised a stall called Build a Microbial
                Factory.</p>

            <div class="spacer3"></div>

            <div class="image-aligner-left">

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
                We also featured The Overlab, a fast-paced, multiplayer game strongly inspired by Overcooked, but set in
                a synthetic biology lab instead of a kitchen. In Overlab, players take on different lab roles to build
                synthetic biology experiments under time pressure, from preparing reagents to assembling plasmids to
                running protocols. Just like in a real lab, teamwork and communication are essential to success. The
                game was a fun way for the children to learn about lab workflows and teamwork in science, in a fun,
                chaotic environment.

            <p style="text-align: left;">We taught kids aged 3 to 7 how a yeast cell functions using a hands-on marble
                game designed to simulate
                the journey of a molecule through a living cell. Children guided a marble which represents a protein or
                molecule, through a colourful, physical model of a yeast cell, passing through key organelles like the
                nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and more. At each station, we explained what that part
                of the cell does in simple, relatable terms (like "<i>this is where the cell reads instructions!" or
                    "this
                    is the cell’s post office!</i>"). We turned complex molecular biology into an immersive experience
                that kids
                could touch, see, and understand. </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Synthetic biology and the greater STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
                Mathematics) field can be portrayed as too advanced or “grown-up,” leaving children out of the
                conversation and its role in shaping the future. We wanted to change that for our project, by creating a
                resource that introduces key concepts in a way that feels familiar, playful, and accessible to young
                audiences.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design an educational colouring book filled with themed
                pages that invite children to “<i>meet the scientists</i>,” imagine themselves doing lab work, and
                explore
                the building blocks of life, such as cells, organs, and even synthetic meat as part of our project. Each
                page was designed with simple, bold outlines for colouring, paired with short, child-friendly
                explanations that encourage curiosity and creativity.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Through combining classic colouring activities with real scientific themes, the
                book makes synthetic biology approachable at an early age, showing that science isn’t just something
                hidden away in labs but part of everyday life and future possibilities. Beyond being fun, it serves as a
                gentle introduction to synthetic biology, planting the seeds of interest in STEM while also helping
                children and their families feel included in scientific conversations.
                <br> <br>
                Once complete, the colouring book was published online and presented in our visits to nurseries.

    <div class="two-column-container">

        <div class="column-left">

            <p style="text-align: left;">For children, science is usually taught and presented as something serious and
                complicated, rather than playful and imaginative. We wanted to challenge that perception by creating a
                resource that makes synthetic biology approachable through storytelling, humour, and relatable
                characters.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design a digital Webtoon-style storybook, starring our
                mascot Sir Loin, and Dr. Pea Pod as they set off on adventures to explore and explain synthetic biology.
                Each episode introduces a new theme about sustainable food and synthetic meat. By personifying
                scientific ideas through characters, we aimed to break down barriers and make abstract concepts easier
                to grasp.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">The comic format allowed us to merge entertainment with education, capturing
                the imagination of younger audiences while also engaging older readers who might be curious but
                intimidated by technical language. Bright artwork and approachable narratives turned synthetic biology
                into a story-driven experience rather than a lecture, showing that science can be both fun and relevant.

            <p style="text-align: left;">For many people, no matter their age or stage in education, entering the field
                of synthetic biology can feel confusing and overwhelming. Since it is still an up-and-coming area in the
                big field of biology, the opportunities, especially in the UK, are numbered.</p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">We wanted to make this journey clearer by creating a career guide that
                introduces the best degrees to pursue for a future in SynBio, along with the wide range of possible
                career paths that follow, with emphasis on academia and industry to startups and entrepreneurship. </p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Drawing on our own team composition and experiences during iGEM, we highlighted
                the degrees that provide strong foundations for synthetic biology, including life sciences, engineering,
                and computational disciplines. For careers, we researched companies and organisations we interacted with
                during the project, as well as leading players we knew in the field, to showcase the diversity of
                opportunities available. </p>

            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Importantly, we also included our own honest reflections and advice to make the
                guide friendly and encouraging.
                <br><br>
                Once completed, we shared the career guide on our Slack community and distributed it directly to high

            <p style="text-align: left;">We understand that our field, synthetic biology, is often described as a “niche
                within a niche”. With that comes a lot of specialised and technical jargon that can make the field feel
                inaccessible to newcomers and the general public. To make our project and synthetic biology more
                approachable, we created a visual dictionary that defines commonly used terms, both from our work and
                the broader field. The aim was to break down complex concepts into simple, easy-to-understand language.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">The glossary includes terms like *gene regulation*, *cultivated meat*,
                *transcription factor.* These and many more are presented with clear, beginner-friendly definitions and
                bold, eye-catching visuals to make complex biology feel approachable and engaging for all audiences.
                <br><br>
                It’s a resource we hope can help students, educators, and the general public feel more confident
                navigating this exciting area of science.

            <p style="text-align: left;">As part of our education efforts, we had the opportunity to connect with the
                Hiroo Gakuen (HG) team from Japan. This conversation was a unique chance to share both scientific
                knowledge and iGEM experience with younger students who are just starting to explore synthetic biology.

            <p style="text-align: left;">We introduced our project and explained how this could contribute to making
                cultivated meat more accessible. Beyond the science, we also discussed the process of getting started in
                iGEM, what it is like to balance lab work with university studies, and how to navigate the challenges of
                building a project from scratch.</p>
