    <p style="text-align: left;">We believe <strong>education</strong> is more than communication—it's about creating
        <strong>connections</strong>, fostering <strong>curiosity</strong>, and giving people the tools to engage
        <strong>critically</strong> with <strong>science</strong>.
        Our education strategy was aimed at <strong>four distinct audiences</strong>—<strong>kindergarten</strong>,
        <strong>high school</strong>,
        <strong>university</strong>, and the <strong>general public</strong>. At every step, our work was
        <strong>reviewed and validated by
            professionals in synthetic biology and sustainable food systems</strong>, ensuring that our materials were
        both
        <strong>accurate</strong> and <strong>impactful</strong>. We tailored our approaches to match the needs of each
        group, while drawing on
        expert guidance to make sure our work stood out as <strong>rigorous, creative, and reliable</strong>.

        We developed <strong>interactive tools</strong>, <strong>narrative formats</strong>, and <strong>inclusive
            events</strong>, always paired with <strong>real
            feedback</strong>—both from audiences and from <strong>leaders in the field</strong>. This dual validation
        meant we could be
        confident our resources were not just engaging, but also <strong>informative</strong>, <strong>useful</strong>,
        and <strong>professionally
            endorsed</strong>.

            <p style="text-align: left;">From the very first spark of curiosity in young children, we wanted science to
                feel <strong>vibrant</strong>, <strong>playful</strong>, and <strong>inclusive</strong>. In our
                <strong>Kindergarten outreach</strong>, we created
                <strong>interactive</strong>, <strong>colourful</strong> experiences that invited children to imagine
                themselves as
                <strong>scientists</strong>, exploring, experimenting, and asking questions. All the
                <strong>nurseries</strong> we visited
                embraced the approach, using and sharing our materials with their children, giving us direct feedback
                that shaped how we presented concepts.
                <br><br>
                Importantly, the <strong>cultivated meat aspects</strong> of our coloring book and activities were
                <strong>reviewed by a
                    regional Good Food Institute representative</strong> and a <strong>Bezos Centre for Sustainable
                    Protein research
                    associate</strong>, who confirmed that our content was both <strong>scientifically accurate</strong>
                and
                <strong>age-appropriate</strong>. This gave us confidence that even our simplest activities were rooted
                in
                professional knowledge, while still sparking <strong>wonder and curiosity</strong>.

        <p style="text-align: left;">At The <strong>Great Exhibition Road Festival</strong>, we had the chance
            to
            introduce <strong>synthetic
                biology</strong>in a fun and
            informal way to young children, including kindergartners. To make molecular biology exciting and
            interactive, we teamed up with the <strong>Good Food Institute</strong> and co-organised a stall
            called
            <strong>Build a Microbial
                Factory</strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">We taught kids aged 3 to 7 how a <strong>yeast cell</strong> functions
            using a
            hands-on <strong>marble
                game</strong> designed to simulate
            the journey of a molecule through a living cell. Children guided a marble which represents a protein
            or
            molecule, through a colourful, physical model of a yeast cell, passing through key organelles like
            the
            <strong>nucleus</strong>, <strong>endoplasmic reticulum</strong>,<strong>Golgi apparatus</strong>,
            and
            more. At each station, we explained what that part
            of the cell does in simple, relatable terms (like "<i>this is where the cell reads instructions!" or
                "this
                is the cell’s post office!</i>"). We turned complex molecular biology into an <strong>immersive
                experience</strong>
            that kids
            could touch, see, and understand.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    We also featured <strong>The Overlab</strong>, a fast-paced, multiplayer game strongly inspired by
                    Overcooked, but set in
                    a <strong>synthetic biology</strong> lab instead of a kitchen. In Overlab, players take on different
                    lab
                    roles to build
                    synthetic biology experiments under time pressure, from preparing reagents to assembling plasmids to
                    running protocols. Just like in a real lab, <strong>teamwork</strong> and
                    <strong>communication</strong>
                    are essential to success. The
                    game was a fun way for the children to learn about lab workflows and teamwork in science, in a fun,
                    chaotic environment.

                    young
                    children, our
                    iGEM team created a <strong>colourful picture book</strong> that introduces the idea of “A Day in

                    Life of a
                    Scientist”. The book was designed with <strong>simple language</strong> and <strong>bright
                        illustrations</strong> to show scientists not
                    just as people in lab coats, but as curious <strong>problem-solvers</strong> who ask questions,
                    explore
                    the world, and
                    try to make life better for everyone. We used the picture book during our nursery visits, where it
                    helped <strong>spark conversations</strong> with children and gave them an <strong>early</strong>,
                    <strong>positive impression</strong> of science.

                    During our nursery visits, the book was <strong>read aloud</strong> to groups of children,
                    encouraging
                    them to <strong>engage
                        with
                        the story</strong> by pointing out details in the illustrations and sharing their own thoughts

                    being future
                    scientists. This <strong>interactive format</strong> helped spark curiosity and gave children an

        <p style="text-align: left;">Synthetic biology and the greater STEM (Science, Technology,
            Engineering,
            and
            Mathematics) field can be portrayed as too <strong>advanced</strong> or “grown-up,” leaving
            children
            <strong>out of the
                conversation</strong> and its role in shaping the future. We wanted to change that for our
            project,
            by creating a
            resource that introduces key concepts in a way that feels <strong>familiar</strong>,
            <strong>playful</strong>, and <strong>accessible</strong> to young
            audiences.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design an <strong>educational</strong> colouring
            book
            filled with themed
            pages that invite children to “<i>meet the scientists</i>,” imagine themselves doing lab work,
            and
            explore
            the building blocks of life, such as cells, organs, and even synthetic meat as part of our
            project.
            Each
            page was designed with <strong>simple</strong>, <strong>bold outlines</strong> for colouring,
            paired
            with <strong>short</strong>, <strong>child-friendly
                explanations</strong> that encourage curiosity and creativity.</p>


        <p style="text-align: left;">Through combining <strong>classic colouring activities</strong> with
            <strong>real
                scientific themes</strong>, the
            book makes synthetic biology <strong>approachable</strong> at an early age, showing that science
            isn’t just
            something
            hidden away in labs but part of <strong>everyday life</strong> and future possibilities. Beyond
            being fun,
            it
            serves as a
            <strong>gentle introduction</strong> to synthetic biology, planting the seeds of interest in
            STEM while also
            helping
            children and their families feel <strong>included</strong> in scientific conversations.
            <br> <br>
            Once complete, the colouring book was published online and presented in our visits to nurseries.

        <p style="text-align: left;">For children, science is usually taught and presented as something
            <strong>serious</strong> and
            <strong>complicated</strong>, rather than <strong>playful</strong> and <strong>imaginative</strong>.
            We
            wanted to <italic>challenge that perception</italic> by creating a
            resource that makes synthetic biology approachable through <strong>storytelling</strong>,
            <strong>humour</strong>, and <strong>relatable
                characters</strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design a <strong>digital Webtoon-style
                storybook</strong>,
            starring our
            mascot Sir Loin, and Dr. Pea Pod as they set off on adventures to explore and explain synthetic
            biology.
            Each episode introduces a new theme about <strong>sustainable food</strong> and <strong>synthetic
                meat</strong>. By <strong>personifying
                scientific ideas</strong> through characters, we aimed to <strong>break down barriers</strong>
            and
            make abstract concepts <strong>easier
                to grasp</strong>.</p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">The <strong>comic format</strong> allowed us to merge <strong>entertainment
                with education</strong>, capturing
            the imagination of younger audiences while also engaging older readers who might be curious but
            intimidated by technical language. <strong>Bright artwork</strong> and <strong>approachable
                narratives</strong> turned synthetic biology
            into a <strong>story-driven experience</strong> rather than a lecture, showing that science can be
            both
            <strong>fun and relevant</strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>


        <p style="text-align: left;">Once completed, the Webtoon was published online and shared across our
            outreach
            channels, where it
            provided a <strong>creative entry point</strong> for new audiences to learn about iGEM and synthetic
            biology.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-content">


        <p style="text-align: left;">For our <strong>kindergarten outreach efforts,</strong> we realised that
            showcasing
            <strong>cultivated meat</strong> to kids can sound very scary, especially to picky eaters. To combat
            this issue, we
            wanted to create a <strong>mascot</strong> that made our project <strong>approachable, fun, and
                memorable</strong>. This led to
            the creation of <strong>Sir Loin</strong>: our mascot cartoon steak with a monocle, moustache, and
            top
            hat, the face
            of Growf when talking to children.
            <br><br>
            To bring him to life, we designed a <strong>do-it-yourself plushie kit</strong> complete with a
            steak
            plush base,
            adhesive felt for facial features, a mini top hat, and templates to guide assembly. The kit was
            <strong>more
                than an arts and crafts project</strong>. It invited children to engage with our projects tough
            SynBio concepts
            through <strong>hands-on creativity</strong>, turning an abstract concept like cultivated meat into
            something
            <strong>tangible and playful</strong>.
            <br><br>
            Shared online and at outreach events, the plushie served as both a <strong>science communication
                tool</strong> and an
            <strong>icebreaker</strong>, helping younger audiences warm up to conversations about the future of
            food.

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            To make science <strong>approachable</strong> and <strong>fun</strong> at an early age, our team launched a
            kindergarten and nursery
            outreach initiative. We visited <strong>three nurseries</strong> to introduce children to the idea of what
            being a
            scientist is like and to share some simple, <strong>age-appropriate</strong> concepts about plant science.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            The sessions were designed to be <strong>interactive</strong> and <strong>playful</strong>. Alongside
            presenting a brief introduction
            for plant science with an experiment, we read from the <strong>picture book</strong> about scientists that
            we created,
            invited children to <strong>colour pages</strong> from our colouring book, and encouraged them to express
            their own ideas
            by <strong>drawing themselves as scientists</strong> on blank sheets of paper.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Through combining <strong>reading</strong>, <strong>colouring</strong>, and <strong>creative
                drawing</strong>, we were able to present science as
            playful and accessible while showing children that they, too, could imagine themselves as scientists. The
            picture book and colouring book now serve as <strong>reusable outreach tools</strong> for future visits,
            ensuring the
            project can continue inspiring interest in STEM at an early age.

                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>High school</strong> is a moment when <strong>curiosity</strong>
                    first becomes
                    <strong>action</strong>: "Who
                    do I want to be? Where might I go next?" Many students interested in <strong>STEM</strong> lack
                    <strong>exposure</strong> to
                    synthetic biology and often don't even know the field <strong>exists</strong>. Our approach centred
                    on
                    <strong>clarity</strong> and <strong>access</strong>. We produced <strong>resources</strong> to
                    demystify the field and help students
                    <strong>critically assess</strong> whether it might be for them.
                    <br><br>
                    Our work was strengthened by the support of <strong>Imperial College Outreach</strong>, who guided
                    us in
                    restructuring our <strong>magazine</strong> for clarity and relevance. Beyond that, our materials
                    were also
                    <strong>endorsed by Prof. Tom Ellis</strong>, co-director of the UK Centre for Synthetic Biology,
                    who approved
                    our approach to introducing synthetic biology and cultivated meat to high schoolers. His validation
                    was crucial: it meant our resources were not only creative but also <strong>professionally relevant
                        and
                        meaningful</strong>.

        <p style="text-align: left;">For many people, no matter their age or stage in education, entering the
            field
            of <strong>synthetic biology</strong> can feel <strong>confusing</strong> and
            <strong>overwhelming</strong>. Since it is still an <strong>up-and-coming</strong> area in the
            big field of biology, the opportunities, especially in the UK, are numbered.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">We wanted to make this journey <strong>clearer</strong> by creating a
            <strong>career guide</strong> that
            introduces the best <strong>degrees</strong> to pursue for a future in SynBio, along with the wide
            range
            of possible
            <strong>career paths</strong> that follow, with emphasis on <strong>academia and industry</strong>
            to
            startups and <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Drawing on our own <strong>team composition</strong> and experiences during
            <strong>iGEM</strong>, we highlighted
            the degrees that provide <strong>strong foundations</strong> for synthetic biology, including
            <strong>life sciences</strong>, <strong>engineering</strong>,
            and <strong>computational disciplines</strong>. For careers, we researched companies and
            organisations
            we interacted with
            during the project, as well as <strong>leading players</strong> we knew in the field, to showcase
            the
            <strong>diversity of
                opportunities available</strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Importantly, we also included our own <strong>honest reflections</strong>
            and
            <strong>advice</strong> to make the
            guide friendly and encouraging.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer2"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;"> Once completed, we shared the career guide on our <strong>Slack community</strong>
            and
            distributed
            it directly to <strong>high
                school students</strong> through their outreach channels, helping prospective SynBio enthusiasts at
            different
            stages feel more <strong>confident</strong> about their next steps.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-content">

        <p style="text-align: left;">We understand that our field, synthetic biology, is often described as a “
            <italic>niche
                within a niche</italic>”. With that comes a lot of <strong>specialised</strong> and
            <strong>technical jargon</strong> that can make the field feel
            <strong>inaccessible</strong> to newcomers and the general public. To make our project and synthetic
            biology more
            <strong>approachable</strong>, we created a <strong>visual dictionary</strong> that defines commonly
            used terms, both from our work and
            the broader field. The aim was to <strong>break down complex concepts</strong> into simple,
            easy-to-understand language.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">The glossary includes terms like <i>gene regulation</i>,<i>cultivated
                meat</i>,
            <i>transcription factor</i>. These and many more are presented with <strong>clear</strong>,
            <strong>beginner-friendly</strong> <strong>definitions</strong>
            and
            <strong>bold</strong>, <strong>eye-catching visuals</strong> to make complex biology feel
            approachable
            and engaging for all audiences.
            <br><br>
            It’s a resource we hope can help <strong>students</strong>, <strong>educators</strong>, and the
            <strong>general</strong> <strong>public</strong> feel more confident
            navigating this exciting area of science.

                <div class="spacer2"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">Through this exchange, we aimed to <strong>demystify iGEM</strong> for high
                    school students
                    while raising awareness about <strong>synthetic biology applications</strong> in the real world. It
                    was
                    both an
                    <strong>educational dialogue</strong> and a moment of <strong>mentorship</strong>, bridging our role
                    as
                    “senior” iGEMers with the <strong>next
                        generation</strong> of synthetic biologists.

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            As part of our outreach to younger students, we hosted a <strong>collaborative webinar</strong> with the
            <strong>Hiroo Gakuen (HG)</strong> team from <strong>Japan</strong>. This event brought together <strong>35
                elementary and high school students</strong> from across Japan to explore the world of <strong>synthetic
                biology</strong> and learn about <strong>lab‑grown meat</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            It was a unique opportunity to communicate science across <strong>continents, languages, and age
                groups</strong>: translating <strong>complex ideas into simple, engaging explanations</strong> that
            could spark curiosity in students just beginning to explore science.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            The webinar was structured to give participants a <strong>broad view</strong> of both schools’ programs and
            projects. We started with an <strong>introduction to iGEM and synthetic biology</strong>, followed by
            <strong>Imperial College’s presentation</strong> about daily life at university and our iGEM project. Each
            segment was designed to be <strong>accessible</strong>, using <strong>clear language</strong> and
            <strong>visuals</strong> to make scientific concepts easy to understand.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            After the presentations, we held an <strong>interactive Q&A</strong> session. Students asked questions about
            <strong>research</strong>, <strong>future careers</strong>, <strong>joining iGEM</strong>, and even what
            it’s like to <strong>study at Imperial and HG</strong>. The conversation was <strong>casual and
                lively</strong>, allowing students to hear directly from us and our Japanese counterparts about our
            <strong>experiences</strong>, <strong>motivations</strong>, and the <strong>excitement</strong> behind our
            projects.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            <strong>Survey feedback</strong> highlighted that participants loved the <strong>Imperial College
                presentations</strong> and were particularly inspired by learning how <strong>lab‑grown meat</strong>
            can be made in a <strong>sustainable</strong> way. Many shared that they were excited to continue exploring
            <strong>synthetic biology</strong> and were motivated to learn more about the <strong>ethical</strong> and
            <strong>scientific</strong> challenges of food innovation.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            This webinar demonstrated how <strong>science communication</strong> can transcend <strong>cultural and
                language barriers</strong>, inspiring young students to engage with <strong>cutting‑edge
                research</strong> and consider <strong>global educational opportunities</strong>.

            <div class="column-right">

                <p style="text-align: left;">This year, our Imperial iGEM team led the <strong>Digital Postcard
                        Initiative</strong>, a <strong>global
                        collaboration</strong> connecting iGEM teams from <strong>every continent</strong> (including
                    high
                    school and university groups).
                    The goal? <strong>To share not just projects</strong>, but <strong>experiences</strong>,
                    <strong>journeys</strong>, and <strong>knowledge</strong>.
                </p>


                <p style="text-align: left;">Each team created a <strong>digital postcard</strong> with artwork and a
                    letter
                    introducing
                    themselves, their university, and their project in <strong>simple, accessible language</strong>.
                    This
                    allowed
                    participants to <strong>learn from each other</strong>, celebrate diverse approaches, and see how
                    <strong>synthetic biology</strong> is
                    tackled in labs across <strong>the world</strong>.
                </p>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                <p style="text-align:left;">But the impact didn’t stop there. All postcards were made <strong>publicly
                        available</strong>,
                    turning them into
                    “<i>synthetic biology love letters.</i>” Each message communicated a team’s passion for synthetic
                    biology and
                    shared it with the <strong>wider public</strong> in an <strong>engaging</strong>,
                    <strong>friendly</strong> way.
                </p>
                <div class="spacer"></div>
                <p style="text-align:left;">Readers can <strong>explore projects from around the globe</strong>, see
                    where
                    teams are
                    based, and learn about the
                    <strong>science behind their work</strong>. By encouraging teams to explain <strong>their projects
                        simply</strong>, we made <strong>cutting-edge</strong>
                    <strong>synthetic biology approachable</strong> for everyone, not just scientists.

                <p style="text-align: left;">This mix was <strong>intentional</strong>, we wanted students to see that
                    synthetic biology
                    can
                    lead to innovations in <strong>diverse fields</strong>. While also raising <strong>important ethical
                        questions</strong>. The variety
                    of
                    topics also helped students <strong>connect</strong> synthetic biology to their own interests,
                    whether
                    they were
                    studying
                    biology, computer science, chemistry, or philosophy. By showcasing both the <strong>exciting
                        potential</strong> and
                    the
                    <strong>complex responsibilities</strong> that come with engineering life, we aimed to challenge
                    narrow
                    views of the
                    field and spark curiosity across disciplines.
                </p>

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;"> We got <strong>many questions</strong> during each of the talks, and the
                    sessions often
                    turned
                    into <strong>open discussions</strong>, with students sharing their own thoughts and asking how to
                    explore certain
                    topics
                    further. Several attendees approached us <strong>after the talks</strong> to continue the
                    conversation,
                    and we were
                    able
                    to provide additional resources and answer follow-up questions. It was clear that the diversity of
                    the
                    topics sparked <strong>genuine</strong> curiosity and <strong>two-way engagement</strong> throughout
                    the
                    session.</p>

            <div class="column-right">

                <p style="text-align: left;">We wanted to show university students just how <strong>broad and
                        exciting</strong> synthetic
                    biology can be, something that often isn’t highlighted in UK academic settings. Our goal was to show
                    students that synthetic biology isn’t just <strong>one thing</strong>, that can be applied across
                    <strong>countless fields</strong>,
                    from
                    health to technology to design. To do this, we collaborated with the <i>Frontiers in Scientific
                        Research
                        Summit</i>, a student-led synthetic biology conference. We hosted a special section featuring
                    <strong>five
                        short
                        crash-course talks</strong> on diverse topics: <i>DNA-based computing and data storage,
                        synthetic
                        perfumery,
                        engineered red blood cells, somatic cell genome editing, and Risks, biosecurity and bioethics
                    </i>.

    <div class="collapsible-content">


        <p style="text-align: left;">We saw a clear gap in the UK for students interested in synthetic biology,
            <strong> unlike more established fields</strong> like clinical research or law, there was <strong>no
                central space</strong> for early
            synthetic biologists to connect, collaborate, and grow. To change this, we launched the <strong>UK
                SynBio
                Circle</strong>, a dedicated UK-regional Slack community, designed specifically for university
            students and
            early-career researchers in the field.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We carefully structured it around the <strong>journey of someone entering
                and
                growing
                in the field</strong>. We created <strong>specific channels</strong> for sharing research
            papers,
            troubleshooting lab
            techniques,
            and discussing current developments in synthetic biology. There’s a space for <strong>conferences
                and
                events</strong>,
            where members can share upcoming talks, workshops, and funding opportunities. Our #opportunities
            channel
            became a <strong>hub for internships, PhD openings, start-up positions, and collaboration
                requests</strong>, and has
            been
            used by several companies to reach talent directly. We also included casual and social channels to
            help
            people meet informally, share ideas, and feel part of a <strong>broader, supportive
                community</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Slack gained traction quickly, <strong>over 150 students</strong> from
            more
            than 12
            universities across the UK joining. Alongside professionals from <strong>five start-ups</strong> who
            shared jobs and
            internships, such as <italic>SynX Therapeutics</italic>. It’s become an <strong>active
                space</strong>
            where students can find each
            other,
            exchange ideas, and take their first steps into the field with a network behind them.

    <div class="collapsible-content">

        <p style="text-align: left;">Synthetic biology is often seen as <strong>abstract and highly
                technical</strong> by the
            general
            public, while researchers can be <strong>reluctant to hold open conversations</strong> with the
            public
            to hear out
            their
            concerns. We wanted to change that by creating a resource that felt <strong>familiar and
                accessible</strong>, while
            still
            delivering serious ideas</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Our solution was to design an educational magazine inspired by the
            <strong>2000s
                teen
                tabloids</strong> many people grew up with, complete with <strong>bold layouts</strong>,
            <strong>quizzes</strong>, <strong>horoscopes</strong>, and <strong>playful
                commentary</strong>. We selected synbio stories that connect <strong>directly to people's
                everyday
                lives</strong> and are
            often
            discussed negatively, such as cultivated meat and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). We paired
            these
            with topics typically limited to <strong>scientific circles</strong>, like lab dress codes or
            microbial
            chassis
            selection, all presented in a <strong>playful, accessible format</strong>. To add another layer of
            interactivity, we
            included <strong>simple mini-experiments</strong> that readers could try at home with common
            household
            items,
            demonstrating basic scientific principles in a fun, accessible way.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Drawing directly from the formatting of <strong>glossy magazines</strong>,
            we
            recreated the
            experience of flipping through a pop-culture tabloid, but instead of celebrity gossip, readers
            discovered stories about <strong>biotechnology</strong>. Once complete, the magazine was shared
            online
            on our social
            media channels like Instagram and Slack, and sent to Imperial’s Department of Bioengineering for
            outreach printing, where it now serves as a <strong>fun entry point</strong> for prospective
            students.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">In doing so, we provided an <strong>unusual but effective way</strong> to
            make
            synthetic
            biology
            approachable, showing that even complex science can be communicated with <strong>humour</strong>,
            <strong>nostalgia</strong>, and
            <strong>creativity</strong>.

                <p style="text-align: left;">This year, with iGEM participation among UK teams dropping to just

                    back in 2016, we recognised the importance of <strong>strengthening connections</strong> across the
                    regional SynBio
                    community. To
                    address this, we focused our outreach on <strong>building the UK SynBio Network</strong> by engaging
                    directly with
                    university
                    societies during their Fresher’s Fairs.

                    science," but to
                    <strong>invite people into the debate</strong>. We designed activities that encouraged people to
                    think about the
                    role biotechnology already plays in their lives — from what's on their plate to how future medicine
                    might be designed — and to consider both its <strong>opportunities</strong> and

                    Our podcast and events in this area were directly inspired by and supported by <strong>Prof. Tom

                    who not only approved the concept but also <strong>suggested formats and tools</strong> that shaped
                    its
                    development. He encouraged us to use podcasts as a way to make synthetic biology both
                    <strong>accessible</strong>
                    and <strong>conversational</strong>, and his early input directly influenced our content choices.
                    The <strong>Synthetic

                        research</strong>.
                    Feedback from participants confirmed that they left with a new perspective and felt more confident

                <p style="text-align: left;">Synthetic biology gives us the <strong>power to design life</strong>, but
                    also
                    the
                    <strong>responsibility</strong> to reflect on its ethical and societal impacts. These conversations
                    are
                    still <strong>emerging</strong>
                    within the field, and often overlooked in scientific training. As an iGEM team, we wanted to help
                    <strong>shift
                        that narrative</strong>.
                </p>

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">To do this, we created an <strong>in-depth essay</strong> exploring key
                    philosophical ideas
                    relevant to synthetic biology. Our goal was to make complex ethical concepts accessible and to show
                    how
                    they apply directly to <strong>real-world biotechnology</strong>. The essay introduces major ethical
                    frameworks like
                    utilitarianism and deontology, as well as modern perspectives such as posthumanism. We explored
                    influential thinkers, including Immanuel Kant, Michel Foucault, and Donna Haraway, and connected
                    their
                    work to current debates in science, from lab-grown meat and GMOs to synthetic organisms and
                    biosecurity.
                </p>


                <p style="text-align: left;">To bring these ideas to life, we also included classic thought experiments
                    like
                    the <i>Ship of Theseus</i> and the <i>Frankenstein Dilemma</i>, using them to challenge assumptions
                    about <strong>identity</strong>,
                    <strong>responsibility</strong>, and the <strong>boundaries between nature and technology</strong>.
                    Throughout the essay, we grounded the
                    discussion in both our own iGEM project and broader societal examples, aiming to make philosophy
                    <strong>relevant</strong> to young scientists and synthetic biologists.
                </p>

                <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p style="text-align: left;">Since its release, the essay has been shared across other iGEM teams and
                    university communities. It helped spark <strong>meaningful</strong> conversations within our own
                    team,
                    shaping how we
                    approached safety, design, and public engagement. This project reminded us that ethics and
                    philosophy
                    shouldn’t be a “second thought”. As synthetic biology advances, so must our thinking about
                    <strong>what
                        it means
                        to engineer life</strong>, and how we can do so with <strong>humility and
                        responsibility</strong>.

        <p style="text-align: left;">In the UK, <strong>iGEM teams have no formal opportunities</strong> to practice for
            the
            Grand
            Jamboree or connect with each other outside their universities, so we set out to create a <strong>national
                Mini
                Jamboree</strong>. Our aim was to give student teams a platform to <strong>rehearse their
                presentations</strong>, <strong>showcase
                synthetic biology</strong> innovation to undergraduates considering joining future teams, and
            <strong>connect students
                directly with researchers</strong>, <strong>industry professionals</strong>, and
            <strong>alumni</strong>. To
            prepare ourselves, we developed a
            <strong> 15-minute project talk</strong> and practiced it over two weeks, ensuring we could present our best
            work to the
            crowd and fellow iGEM teams.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">As organisers, we needed to secure <strong>speakers</strong>,
            <strong>booths</strong>,
            <strong>a venue</strong>, <strong>funding</strong>, and
            <strong>volunteers</strong>,
            while
            also designing interactive elements such as <strong>live Q&As</strong> and <strong>question submission
                forms</strong>. We reached out to over
            <strong> 30+
                companies</strong> to bring in leading voices from the synbio community, booked one of Imperial’s
            <strong>most prestigious
                lecture theatres</strong>, and held <strong>one-to-one preparation meetings</strong> with every speaker.
            The
            final line-up featured
            some
            of the UK’s most exciting startups and researchers: <strong>David Kim</strong> of
            <strong>CyanoCapture</strong>
            and<strong> Shan Jiang</strong>, iGEM alumnus
            and
            founder of <strong>Ailurus Bio</strong>, delivered keynotes; <strong>Kärt Tomberg</strong> of
            <strong>ExpressionEdits</strong> joined us for an <strong>interactive
                fireside chat</strong> using a new live Q&A platform; <strong>Martin Carballo Pacheco</strong>
            represented
            <strong>Hoxton Farms</strong> with a
            workshop on
            <strong>cultivated meat technology</strong>; and our Future of Biotech panel showcased the journeys of
            <strong>FullCircleLabs</strong>, <strong>Change
                Bio</strong>, and <strong>Amytis</strong>, three early-stage startups using <strong>AI and
                automation</strong> to transform biotechnology.

                <p style="text-align: left;">Beyond the programme itself, our team designed the <strong>agenda</strong>,
                    <strong>accessibility
                        guides</strong>, and <strong>infographic content </strong>for guests, coordinated volunteers
                    through
                    a dedicated <strong>application
                        process</strong>, and kept up <strong>daily social media updates </strong>leading up to the date
                    to
                    build anticipation. During
                    the
                    event, we ran student team presentations with <strong>live Q&As</strong> from alumni and industry
                    professionals,
                    <strong>filmed
                        short videos</strong> during breaks to capture instant feedback, and ensured every session
                    encouraged
                    <strong>audience
                        interaction</strong>.

        <p style="text-align: left;">The event drew over <strong>60+ engaged attendees</strong> and received
            outstanding
            feedback: our
            survey reported average satisfaction scores of <strong>4.73/5</strong> for speaker selection and
            <strong>4.82/5</strong> for resources
            and
            communication, with <strong>91%</strong> of respondents saying they would return next year. One
            participant
            reflected,
            “The Future of Biotech panel was very candid. The panelists were super warm and helpful when
            answering
            questions and left me inspired to do my own research on what they talked about!”
        </p>

        <div class="spacer2"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Overall, the Mini Jamboree was a <strong>vibrant success</strong>. For iGEM
            teams,
            it
            provided
            <strong>invaluable practice before Paris</strong>; for the broader audience, it was an inspiring
            showcase of
            what
            synthetic biology can achieve when students, academics, and entrepreneurs come together — and proof that
            it is <strong>never too early to start building in synthetic biology</strong>.

                    Results showed that while <strong>medicine</strong> was the best-known

                <p style="text-align: left;">The MIT-MAHE Team recalled how in <strong>India</strong>, trust is
                    measured
                    in
                    relation to
                    how
                    biotechnology <strong>directly affects daily life</strong>, such as how local farmers interact
                    with
                    GM
                    crops.
                    However, the Yale
                    Team described that in the <strong>United States</strong>, people tend to see genetic
                    modification
                    as
                    <strong>part of
                        everyday life</strong>,
                    normalised through large-scale commercial agriculture where distinctions between GM and non-GM
                    products are less
                    relevant.

                <p style="text-align: left;"> The two-hour conversation was both a platform to <strong>exchange
                        perspectives</strong> on
                    the survey and an opportunity to <strong>practice our presentation skills</strong> across
                    continents. We
                    had a long
                    conversation
                    about how different factors influence trust in science, the strongest contrasts being from
                    <strong>cultural
                        and
                        legislative environments</strong>.

        <p style="text-align: left;"> In contrast, we highlighted how in <strong>Europe</strong>, bans and
            restrictions
            confine genetic
            engineering largely
            to <strong>academia and the pharmaceutical sector</strong>, shaping a more cautious public perception,
            and
            less
            public trust in
            genetic modification. Despite these differences, a unifying theme emerged: <strong>younger generations
                across
                regions
                displayed a notably positive outlook</strong> on synthetic biology, suggesting that they will play a
            key
            role in shaping
            broader acceptance of the field in the future.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Did you know that over half of adults <strong>regularly listen to
                podcasts</strong>,
            often
            using
            them to learn something new <strong>while going about their day</strong>?<strong> We thought</strong>:
            why
            not
            bring synthetic biology
            to
            this <strong>growing medium</strong>? <strong>With this in mind</strong>, we <strong>launched</strong> a
            <strong>podcast aimed at reaching</strong> the general public
            in a
            <strong>lighthearted</strong>, <strong>accessible</strong> way.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>







        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Hosted by two of our team members</strong>, each episode features
            interviews
            with different
            <strong>iGEM</strong>
            members discussing a topic in synthetic biology that they are passionate about. <strong>Guests also
                share
                their
                journey</strong>
            into synthetic biology and iGEM, providing insight into how others can get involved, whether at high
            school,
            undergraduate, or postgraduate levels.
            <br><br>
            This approach makes the podcast both <strong>educational and inspiring</strong>, covering not only the
            science
            behind
            synthetic
            biology but also personal stories and experiences.
            Our episodes have explored a wide range of topics, including the <strong>fundamentals of synthetic
                biology</strong>,
            <strong>biomanufacturing</strong> and its <strong>scaling challenges</strong>, <strong>GMOs</strong>,
            <strong>biological pattern formation</strong>, and<strong> women in biotech</strong>
            <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>.
            <br><br>
            We’ve also welcomed guest iGEM teams, such as the Manipal team from India, to share their experiences
            and
            perspectives. This has made the podcast a platform for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and discussion
            across
            teams, generations, and audiences.
            <br><br>
            In addition to the discussions, we’ve <strong>incorporated creativity and music</strong> into the
            project.
            One
            team member,
            combining their passion for synthetic biology and music, produced a unique <strong>podcast
                jingle</strong>
            using
            lab sounds
            and
            instruments creating a “<strong>magical lab</strong>” vibe that reflects the sci-fi and innovative
            spirit of
            our
            field.
            <br><br>

        </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Listener feedback reflects the podcast’s ability to <strong>engage</strong>
            audiences
            from different
            backgrounds:</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <ul>
            <li style="text-align: left;">
                <blockquote>“<i>I’d never heard of Symbio before, and honestly, it sounded kind of sci-fi to me. But
                        I’m
                        really glad I clicked on it on my way to work. Now I can actually join in when people talk
                        about
                        GMOs at dinner.</i>”</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">
                <blockquote>“<i>I’ve been trying to get into biotech entrepreneurship and have been consuming all
                        sorts
                        of
                        content, but this episode was different. It felt honest, not overhyped, and really
                        down-to-earth.</i>”</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">
                <blockquote>“<i>What I love about this podcast is it makes you think about Synthetic Biology outside
                        the
                        lab. It’s not just experiments or companies, it’s ethics, society, futuristic possibilities.
                        I
                        always end up thinking about stuff I wouldn’t have considered before, which is super
                        cool.</i>”
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Overall, the podcast has become an <strong>innovative educational</strong> tool
            that
            transcends
            traditional media and
            demographics. It’s a <strong>fun</strong>, <strong>accessible</strong> way for the public to learn about
            synthetic biology while highlighting the
            <strong>collaborative</strong> and <strong>creative</strong> culture of iGEM.

                <p style="text-align: left;">As part of our public education strategy, we wanted a way to make
                    people
                    reflect on bioethics in an accessible, on-the-go format. Quizzes are something we all enjoy: on
                    the
                    bus,
                    at home, or shared with friends. Instead of “<i>Which character are you?</i>”, our quiz asks:
                    What
                    do
                    your
                    choices reveal about ethics in the age of synthetic biology?
                    <br><br>
                    That idea became The Moral Code: an immersive quiz that reimagines the classic “<i>Trolley
                        Problem</i>”
                    for
                    today’s scientific frontiers.

                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    The Moral Code takes players through five ethical worlds, each tied to a framework that guides
                    decisions
                    in science. Early choices feel simple, but later dilemmas demand real moral trade-offs.

        <p style="text-align: left;"> You’ll face <strong>crisis responses in The Outbreak</strong>
            (utilitarianism),
            <strong>risk-versus-innovation in The Green
                Lab</strong> (precautionary principle), <strong>questions of fairness in The Divide</strong>
            (justice &
            equity), <strong>personal
                rights in The Trial</strong> (autonomy & consent), and finally <strong>enhancement in The Horizon
                Project</strong>
            (posthumanism).
            <br><br>
            Every choice is tracked across four axes: <strong>Idealism, Realism, Rebellion,</strong> and
            <strong>Skepticism,</strong> which
            reveal your archetype: <strong>The Idealist, The Realist, The Rebel,</strong> or <strong>The
                Skeptic.</strong>
            In rare cases, when
            answers deeply contradict, the system overrides and gives <strong>The Mirror,</strong> reflecting back
            inner
            conflict
            instead of a score.
            <br><br>
            To intensify the journey, the game also delivers <strong>thought interruptions,</strong> sudden prompts
            that
            stop the
            story and force you to justify a choice, like: "<i>You chose to silence a community for the greater
                good.
                How do you justify that?</i>" These moments turn abstract dilemmas into personal reflection.
            <br><br>
            The Moral Code does not tell players what is right or wrong. Instead, it highlights how advances in
            synthetic
            biology make old ethical debates urgent again. By playing, participants see how their values influence
            decisions
            about risk, fairness, and identity.

            This makes bioethics tangible and personal, showing that science is never just technical, it is also
            social
            and
            moral.
            <br><br>
            As biotechnology grows more powerful, society faces choices that affect everyone. Should we enhance
            human
            traits? Release engineered microbes? Who gets access first?

            Through this quiz, we invite the public to reflect on these questions in a simple, playful way. Our hope
            is
            to
            spark dialogue, critical thinking, and awareness about the futures synthetic biology could create.

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            When we organised our <strong>UK Mini‑Jamboree</strong>, one fact struck us: for a country with dozens of
            world‑leading universities, <strong>the number of UK iGEM teams is surprisingly small</strong>. We quickly
            realised this is not unique to the UK—participation in iGEM has been <strong>shrinking globally</strong>,
            <strong>despite the growing number of synthetic biology societies</strong> and passionate students eager to
            take part.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Why is this happening? From our own experience and from conversations with students across the UK and
            abroad, the answer is clear: <strong>the barriers to starting an iGEM team are high</strong>.
            <strong>Funding</strong> is the biggest hurdle, with <strong>registration fees</strong> and <strong>lab
                costs</strong> proving prohibitive for many groups. But money isn’t the only issue. Many universities
            lack experienced <strong>advisors</strong> in synthetic biology, while students often feel uncertain about
            <strong>logistics</strong>, <strong>rules</strong>, and the sheer <strong>scope</strong> of running a
            year‑long project.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            We saw this gap first‑hand. During our <strong>Welcome Outreach Tour</strong>, we spoke with students from
            universities such as <strong>Edinburgh</strong> and <strong>Manchester</strong>, where synthetic biology
            societies exist but <strong>no iGEM team has been able to take root</strong>. One Edinburgh student
            explained they had dreamt of competing since high school but <strong>never knew how to begin,</strong> while
            a Manchester student told us <strong>funding</strong> <strong>challenges</strong> had already derailed past
            attempts. Similar stories arose during our <strong>webinar</strong> with <strong>Hiroo</strong> (Japan),
            where participants voiced the <strong>same frustrations</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            To address this, we created a “Getting Started with <strong>iGEM</strong>” <strong>guide</strong>—a
            practical resource designed specifically for university students who want to turn enthusiasm into action.
            The guide breaks down the essentials:
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <ul>
            <li style="text-align:left;">Forming a <strong>team</strong> (finding members, building
                <strong>skillsets</strong>)
            </li>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <li style="text-align:left;">Securing <strong>advisors</strong> and <strong>lab space</strong> (including
                the option of <strong>remote</strong> or <strong>international</strong> mentorship)</li>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <li style="text-align:left;"><strong>Funding</strong> strategies (from <strong>university</strong> support
                to <strong>sponsors</strong>)</li>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <li style="text-align:left;">Running a <strong>project</strong> (<strong>ideation</strong>,
                <strong>research</strong>, <strong>communication</strong>, and <strong>human practices</strong>)
            </li>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <li style="text-align:left;">Understanding <strong>rules</strong> and <strong>structure</strong> (helping
                new teams navigate <strong>deadlines</strong> and <strong>deliverables</strong>)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Importantly, this is not just an administrative checklist. It reflects the <em>real challenges</em> that
            teams like ours have faced, and the <strong>solutions</strong> we and others have used to overcome them. For
            example, one of our <strong>advisors</strong> is based in <strong>India</strong>—proving that teams do not
            need to rely solely on local faculty for <strong>mentorship</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Impact and validation</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            The guide has already proven its value. We shared it widely during our <strong>Freshers’ Outreach
                Tour</strong>, and several societies expressed interest in <strong>reviving</strong> or
            <strong>founding</strong> teams. For us, even this single outcome represents a powerful step towards
            <strong>rebuilding</strong> the <strong>network</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Our resource was also <strong>validated</strong> by one of our <strong>advisors</strong>, a past
            <strong>iGEM</strong> High School judge, who confirmed its <strong>relevance</strong> and
            <strong>accessibility</strong> for new teams.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Looking forward</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            We see this guide not as a final solution, but as a starting point to <strong>lower</strong> barriers and
            <strong>expand</strong> access to <strong>iGEM</strong>. By equipping motivated students with the knowledge
            to overcome <strong>funding</strong>, <strong>mentorship</strong>, and <strong>logistical</strong> hurdles,
            we hope to inspire new teams to form—and to see more universities represented at future
            <strong>Jamborees</strong>, including our next <strong>Mini‑Jamboree</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            In short, this resource is our contribution to <strong>sustaining</strong> the international
            <strong>iGEM</strong> <strong>community</strong>. It acknowledges the <strong>obstacles</strong> openly
            while showing that, with <strong>guidance</strong> and <strong>persistence</strong>, <strong>iGEM</strong>
            can be accessible to far more students worldwide.

        Our work achieved strong <strong>validation at every level</strong>:
    </p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <ul>
        <li style="text-align:left;"><strong>Nurseries</strong> adopted our materials.</li>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <li style="text-align:left;"><strong>Imperial Outreach</strong> helped improve our high school and university
            resources.</li>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <li style="text-align:left;"><strong>Prof. Tom Ellis</strong> (UK Centre for Synthetic Biology) endorsed our
            high school, university, and general public strategies, and directly inspired our <strong>podcast</strong>.
        </li>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <li style="text-align:left;"><strong>Good Food Institute</strong> representatives and a <strong>Bezos Centre
                associate</strong> validated the <strong>cultivated meat content</strong> woven into all of our
            materials.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        This professional approval gave our work a unique strength: it was not only <strong>creative and
            inclusive</strong>, but also <strong>recognized by leaders in the field</strong> as accurate, valuable, and
        impactful.
    </p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        We are proud that our programme maintained a thread of <strong>cultivated meat</strong> throughout without
        letting it dominate—allowing us to showcase the <strong>full complexity</strong> of synthetic biology while
        ensuring <strong>accuracy and authority</strong>. At the same time, we acknowledge that our <strong>reach
            remains strongest locally (UK)</strong>, and that some of our in-person activities (e.g. picture book
        visits) are <strong>resource-intensive</strong>, limiting scale. Going forward, we aim to
        <strong>translate</strong> these into shareable formats and integrate more <strong>technical content</strong>,
        building on the strong foundation of professional validation we’ve already secured.

            <strong>drawing, public panels, surveys, and podcasts</strong> encouraged not just participation but also
            <strong>conversation</strong>, with feedback guiding our next steps.</li>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <li style="text-align:left;"><strong>Inclusive reach across demographics</strong>: We created tailored resources
            for <strong>kindergartens</strong>, <strong>high schoolers</strong>, <strong>university students</strong>,
            and the <strong>general public</strong>.</li>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <li style="text-align:left;"><strong>Professional validation & endorsement</strong>: At every stage, our
            resources were reviewed and supported by <strong>leaders in synthetic biology</strong> (Prof. Tom Ellis, UK
            Centre for Synthetic Biology) and <strong>sustainable protein experts</strong> (Good Food Institute, Bezos
            Centre associate). This ensured our content was <strong>accurate, trustworthy, and unique</strong>.</li>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <li style="text-align:left;"><strong>Innovative tools & formats</strong>: We used <strong>storytelling</strong>,
            <strong>picture books</strong>, <strong>podcasts</strong>, <strong>seminars</strong>, and
            <strong>interactive quizzes</strong>, going well beyond standard lectures.</li>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <li style="text-align:left;"><strong>Scalability and replication</strong>: Many of our materials (e.g.
            <strong>picture books, guides, quizzes</strong>) are adaptable and designed with replication in mind.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        In summary, our programme stands out because it is not only <strong>validated by audiences</strong> but also
        <strong>endorsed by professionals</strong>, combining creativity with <strong>authority</strong>. This gives us
        confidence that our work demonstrates the <strong>depth, breadth, and reliability</strong> worthy of the
        <strong>Best Education Award</strong>.
