                        <p style="text-align: left;">Hi, I’m Jonathan. I’m from Indonesia. I both love and hate the
                            sheer complexity of biology, but applying it is my favorite part. I’m really interested in
                            how biology does so well to stop us from scaling it up so it can have real impact on our
                            society. So right now I’ve put myself at the intersections of biomanufacturing, bioprocess
                            engineering, and optimization. Outside the lab, you’ll usually find me swimming or behind a
                            camera.</p>

                            dive one day — always chasing the next challenge. When I’m not hands-on with biotech in the
                            lab, I love coming up with crazy venture ideas and seeing where they take me.</p>

                    academic interests orbit around healthtech, therapeutics, and innovation! And when I’m not
                    deep in ideas, I’m probably getting stained with paint. I signed up for iGEM to make bio a
                    little wilder... Stay tuned and see what’s next :)</p>

                    <p style="text-align: left;">I am a post-doctoral bioengineering research associate at Imperial College London, working
                    with Prof. Tom Ellis, Central Saint Martins and an LVMH subsidiary towards sustainable
                    protein-based materials. Following my PhD, I am developing my biological engineering
                    experience with industry-appropriate methodologies. My ambition is to support biotech
                    solutions to reduce human impact on our environment. I believe this impact will be
                    substantially achieved through the rapid scale-up in food-grade recombinant macromolecules.

                    <p style="text-align: left;">Hey there! I’m Lisa! Originally from Germany, I’ve been living in the UK for a while now,
                    where I completed my PhD in Cambridge. My research focused on stress pathways in mammalian
                    cells, and I expressed and purified over 100 different proteins for biophysical analysis.
                    Now, I joined the food team at the RLA lab to explore the use of Yarrowia lipolytica for
                    biomass fermentation. I’m passionate about community building — I’m a regional mentor for
                    the Good Food Institute, where I support student groups in the sustainable food tech space.
                    To balance all that brain work, I love staying active. You’ll often find me climbing,
                    dancing (5Rhythms and contact improvisation), hiking, or taking a cold water swim.</p>

                    lipolytica to produce various lipids, particularly food oils. I am passionate about
                    advancing microbial biotechnology to create sustainable solutions for the future of food
