        <div class="spacer5"></div>
        Early in our ideation phase, we consulted with Dr. Lisa Neidhardt and Dr. Oliver
        Konzock, both Postdoctoral Researchers at the Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro lab with experience in yeasts such as
        <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>.
        <br><br>
        We initially organized a meeting with Dr. Neidhardt, a member of the Bezos Centre for Sustainable Protein and
        regional mentor for the Good Food Institute, to discuss how we could frame our project with the goal of
        contributing to the field of alternative proteins.
        <br><br>
        Dr. Neidhardt highlighted the inefficient practices of traditional food production, such as the 8:1 calorie
        conversion ratio for chicken, and outlined current examples of sustainable proteins in the industry. She also
        highlighted the many regulatory burdens that the alternative protein industry faces today, which are limiting
        its real-world applications.
        <br><br>
        Based on Dr. Neidhardt’s initial meeting, we chose to focus on cultivated meat, a facet of alternative
        proteins
        that remains largely underexploited in industry, likely due to technical barriers that drive up costs. In
        particular, we chose to focus on researching into recombinant growth factor production, as it remains one of
        the
        primary cost barriers in the cultivated meat industry.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Our first meeting with Dr Konzock aimed to cover the range of possible microbial
          chassis we could choose from for our project. Oliver walked us through the design and transformation cycle for
          the yeast he was currently working on, Yarrowia lipolytica. The main takeaway from this was that the chassis’
          slow growth cycles and need for non-standard DNA parts would make it unfeasible at the iGEM timescale. A
          single DBTL cycle could take over a month, thus leaving us very little time for further work.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, we benefited from Dr. Konzock’s previous experience with iGEM, namely his work in wet lab and
          team leadership capacities at the Technische Universität Braunschweigm team in 2013 and 2014 respectively, as
          we gained valuable insight on the feasibility and appeal of our project from a former iGEMer’s point of view.
          He advised us to angle our project in a way that could easily be communicated to the wider public, even when
          significantly abstracted.
          <br><br>
          Following this conversation, we reached out to additional experts to investigate whether other yeast chassis
          like <i>Komagataella phaffii</i> would allow for a greater number of engineering cycles within the same
          timeframe.
          If feasible, this would significantly reduce our experimental risk.
          <br><br>
          Dr. Neidhardt and Dr. Konzock’s honest assessment gave us the clarity we needed in picking which chassis to
          prioritise, shaping a more time-resilient strategy for the wet lab component of our project. We onboarded them
          as advisors for our project.

        Continuing our chassis selection process, we met with Dr. Alex Van de Steen, a postdoctoral researcher with
        expertise in <i>Pichia pastoris</i>. This consultation aimed to clarify the practical timelines associated
        with <i>Pichia</i> engineering and to evaluate whether it was the most strategic choice for our project
        goals.
        Dr. Alex Van de Steen confirmed that <i>Pichia</i> transformation timelines can be compressed to under one
        month and, with optimisation, may approach the speed of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. However, he also
        emphasised that unless our project specifically required <i>Pichia’s</i> strengths, such as high volumetric
        protein yield, absence of self-inhibition, or superior secretion capacity, there was no inherent advantage
        in
        selecting it over faster or more extensively characterised organisms like <i>E. coli.</i>
        <br><br>
        Since our initial concept was to leverage secretion capabilities in growth factor production, this
        consultation gave us the confidence to move forward with <i>Pichia pastoris</i> as our chassis of choice.
        Achieving a balance between industrial relevance with practical achievability in the lab.

        <p style="text-align: left;">Very early on in our journey, we met with Reka Tron, former COO at Multus, a
          media optimisation company catering to the cultured meat sector. Reka has overseen operations ranging from
          regulatory compliance and procurement to long term-strategy during her five years at Multus.
          <br><br>
          Our focus was understanding the key challenges in industrial <i>K. phaffii</i> applications and the broad
          external perception of a media company catering towards cultured meat cultivation.
          <br><br>
          Reka shared her company’s experience on working with the growth factors fundamental to our project. Through
          her industry insider viewpoint, we obtained necessary validation of IGF-1, EGF, and HGF being widely
          demanded in cultivated meat. She stated that while IGF-1 and EGF, being smaller growth factors, were
          relatively easy to verify in <i>K. phaffii</i>, larger growth factors such as HGF posed a significant
          challenge,
          as it has a highly complex shape and is heavily cleaved. She also suggested FGF2, one of the cheapest and
          easiest to produce, as another potential growth factor of interest.
          <br><br>
          Moreover, Reka stated that Multus has engineered several of their growth factors for better dose-response
          properties, serving as an example of a different approach to improving growth factor economics in cultured
          meat. However, we evaluated that the relative impact our project could have was not meaningfully enhanced by
          performing such protein engineering on growth factors, particularly not given our existing timeline
          challenges.
          <br><br>
          The second part of our conversation was centered around public and industry opinion. Reka emphasized an
          attention shift towards media composition and sourcing, especially to sustainable and “waste” carbon
          sources, within the industry. On the other hand, she also pointed out that the public narrative is shifting
          and has resulted in declining end-consumer enthusiasm and waning investor interest. We reconciled these as
          being signs of a more grounded and less optimistic industry atmosphere adjusting to investor confidence in
          the sector.
          <br><br>
          Reka also connected us to Hoxton Farms and Catherine from Qkine, extending our network in the cultivated
          meat space and helping us situate our work within the wider ecosystem.

        <p style="text-align: left;">We held two in-depth consultations with Brandon Ma, Senior Scientist and Co-Founder
          of Multus, to refine both our technical execution and project strategy in *K. phaffii* engineering. From his
          experience pivoting away from *K. phaffii*-based growth factor production, Brandon highlighted the challenges
          of an overcrowded landscape, CMO (Contract Manufacturing Organization) dependencies, and patent restrictions,
          encouraging us to frame our proof-of-concept around reduced sugar production rather than immediate growth
          factor purification.
          <br><br>
          He also gave us plenty of advice for working with *K. phaffii*. He recommended beginning with the wild type
          CBS 7435 strain, using small constructs with ~80 ng DNA input, and screening over 100 clones via 96-well
          plates with dot blots for validation. We deemed this infeasible at iGEM scales and did not implement this for
          our project. He additionally shared practical troubleshooting tips, including monitoring pellet color and
          smell for contaminants, and using dual antibiotic selection.
          <br><br>
          For CRISPR design, Brandon advised manually validating primers against the *K. phaffii* genome using NCBI
          files, ordering multiple primer sets, and sequencing bands when gels are inconclusive. He recommended specific
          software for codon optimization and suggested ordering multiple optimized variants to compare expression.
          <br><br>
          In terms of targets, he advised us to prioritize EGF and IGF due to their higher stability. Brandon raised
          some concerns against our plan to focus on HGF production, since the 3-balls-on-a-chain structure is prone to
          cleavage. He suggested producing FGF2, a smaller, more stable protein. Consequently, we introduced FGF2 as a
          more feasible target protein alongside HGF for confirmation of our rPOI expression workflow.

        <p style="text-align: left;">We consulted Dr. Ruben Perez-Carrasco to refine our approach to Bayesian
          optimization for carotenoid pathway engineering. Specifically, we focused on techniques and approaches to
          dealing with biological noise that is intrinsic to synthetic biology wet lab experiments.
          <br><br>
          To validate the method, he recommended creating a synthetic dataset with simple ODE outputs and Gaussian noise
          inputs before moving to more complex equations. Heteroscedastic noise should only be introduced and tested
          after sufficient model accuracy is confirmed with homoscedastic noise.
          <br><br>
          Regarding new tools, Ruben highlighted the PyMC library for Bayesian interference, which could be used to
          isolate the experimentally derived variables and reinsert them back into the model. This was tested as part of
          the optimisation stack.
          <br><br>
          As a response to our proposed experimental design, he stressed ensuring that cell cultures remain in the log
          growth phase, since overcrowding inherently changes the metabolic state of a cell. Finally, he provided key
          literature references, which all helped us to build our dry lab components.

        <p style="text-align: left;">We contacted Dr. Noah Sprent, co-founder of ChangeBio, a startup focusing on
          industrial protein manufacturing innovation in *K. phaffii*, while planning our mini jamboree. We found an
          overlap in interest on fundamental, open contributions to support commercially viable *K. phaffii*
          applications.
          <br><br>
          Our cell wall and mannose pathway targeting was validated as a potential blind spot in engineering of the
          Chassis, given the long running history of trHoc1 strains with little iteration. Dr. Sprent agreed on the
          essentiality of downstream processing efficiency gains, as well as the room for improvement present there. As
          this is the first year of *K. phaffii* being greenlit as a Chassis, we planned a collaboration to publish the
          whole genome sequence of a strain lacking commercial licensing issues or restrictions. This is part of an
          effort spearheaded by Dr. Sprent named PhaffiiNet, which aims to avoid the commercial red tape around *K.
          phaffii* strains that Dr. Sprent ran into commercial licensing limitations with.
          <br><br>
          He agreed to transfer the strain to us for validation purposes and thus support the development of *K.
          phaffii* as a commercial strain within iGEM.
          <br><br>
          Dr. Sprent generously offered us a 2L bioreactor to run a trial fermentation in, which would yield more
          industrially relevant results than shake flask cultures.
          <br><br>
          He also flagged issues of using CRISPR for commercial and industrial use cases due to licensing issues, and
          proposed the alternative of using a split marker double-crossover with a floxed episomal resistance marker. It
          was concluded that we could emulate our edits using this method if commercialisation was our goal, though by
          this point the strategy was not feasible as we had already followed through with our CRISPR recombination
          engineering.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, Dr. Sprent directed us towards several industry experts in *K. phaffii* manufacturing at scale,
          including Mark Warner and Blake Byrne, who we later reached out to.

        <p style="text-align: left;">Our team consulted with Dr. Martin Carballo Pacheco, a senior scientist at Hoxton
          Farms, a biotechnology company pioneering cultivated pork fat production. Hoxton farms focuses on cultivated
          pork fat and closely aligns with what would be an ideal partner for our business case. Martins expertise in
          technical bottlenecks, industry practices, and market factors was key for our perception of cultivated meat
          industry.
          <br><br>
          Dr. Carballo Pacheco has helped us to understand the perspective of a cultivation-focused company, furthering
          our understanding of the demand-side concerns in the growth factor market. Key challenges to expansion were
          described as transition from research to commercial scale, expensive validation studies for stirred tank
          bioreactors, and lack of established market for bulk growth factors. Although growth factors are available on
          the milligram scale, finding suppliers that would produce kilogram-scale food-grade and low-cost growth
          factors remains an unsolved issue. Martin has also directed us towards a report
          [https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cultivated-meat-media-and-growth-factor-trends-2020.pdf] from the
          Good Food Institute, which outlines that growth factors can contribute up to 90% of media cost.
          <br><br>
          This has confirmed our initial focus on growth factors for synthetic meat, but more importantly showed that
          projects financial success will be determined by matching a market need. This was further emphasized by
          Martin’s advice to partner with real world companies for validation of real world applications.
          <br><br>
          We also discussed Hoxton’s use of specific data science methods, namely Bayesian optimization, for rapid,
          small-scale media testing before scaling to pilot reactors. Specifically, the utility of transfer learning in
          Bayesian optimization for faster and lower experimental footprint scale-up optimization was confirmed. It
          validated our decision to a similar computational tools in our modelling workflow.

          Finally, Martin was one of the key speakers for our Food Tech panel during the Mini Jamboree we hosted at
          Imperial College London. He delivered a well-received presentation about the science and hard work that makes
          cultivated pork fat a reality of today rather a dream of tomorrow. He also generously provided another round
          of feedback for our preliminary project pitch at the mini jamboree.

        <p style="text-align: left;">We met with Konstantin, a Purification Development Scientist at Lonza, to refine
          our protein purification strategy. His expertise in downstream bioprocessing and industrial-scale purification
          was particularly relevant to our use of *K. phaffii* for growth factor production in a food-grade context.
          <br><br>
          Konstantin confirmed that *K. phaffii* is a suitable chassis for food applications that require complex
          proteins but not necessarily humanised glycosylation. He explained that most growth factors fall below 1000
          amino acids, making purification more manageable, and that post-translational modifications are less critical
          in food than in therapeutic settings.
          <br><br>
          The consultation confirmed our choice of using His-tag affinity chromatography to purify and quantify our
          recombinant proteins, as we were told to avoid size exclusion chromatography due to some inefficiencies at
          large scale.
          <br><br>
          He also recommended reverse-phase chromatography as a low-cost alternative, especially for small, refoldable
          proteins. Konstantin further provided insight into realistic yields (0.5 g/L in *K. phaffii*) and scale-up
          strategies, advocating for 1000L single-use bioreactors and ISO 7 food-grade facilities, which reduce
          sterility and QA costs compared to pharmaceutical production.

        <p style="text-align: left;">Dr. Martina Miotto is the cofounder of CellRev, a company that just stoped trading
          recently. She shared her experience building a company that initially focused on cellular agriculture before
          ultimately pivoting toward pharma. Her journey highlighted both the promise and the pitfalls of the cultivated
          meat industry: despite developing a high-yield, continuous adherent cell manufacturing process and securing
          strong pharma trial partners, her team faced declining investment in cellular agriculture and long decision
          timelines after pivoting towards pharma, leading to the company’s closure. Martina emphasized the harsh
          realities of the current investment climate, overpromising by cultivated meat companies, waning investor
          confidence, and the particular difficulty of raising funds for enabling technologies rather than
          consumer-facing products. From this, she advised us to carefully balance diversification with focus, explore
          quicker market entry points, and prioritize revenue generation strategies such as non-dilutive funding and
          B2B-focused investors. Most importantly, she encouraged us to simplify our narrative for non-technical
          stakeholders and to critically evaluate the implementation challenges of our chosen market. Her candid
          reflections offered us invaluable perspective on both strategic pitfalls and resilience in biotech
          entrepreneurship, allowed us to highlight issues with the cultivated meat industry through our work, helping
          shape the way we frame Growf’s pathway to impact.

        <p style="text-align: left;">Early in our project, after we finished scientific ideation, we met with Victoria
          Faber, former Chief of Staff at Lightspeed Venture Partners & Angel Investor, to refine the strategic
          narrative behind our pitch deck.
          <br><br>
          With deep storytelling expertise gained during her time at McKinsey and later at Lightspeed, Victoria helped
          us move beyond academic framing and shape a compelling, investor-ready story with pitch-perfect slides. She
          guided us to structure the deck as a high-level narrative, moving from a bold problem statement to a visionary
          solution and strategic edge, all while emphasising visual clarity. We discussed how to simplify technical
          language without losing depth, reorder slides for greater impact, and use whitespace and pacing to hold
          attention. Her slide-by-slide feedback led us to rebuild our deck with thematic titles, more intuitive design,
          and a clearer value proposition for external partners.
          <br><br>
          The two meetings held with her fundamentally shifted our communication strategy, helping us transition from a
          lab-focused mindset to a high-conviction pitch aligned with industry and investor expectations. This
          foundation proved invaluable for our subsequent meetings with investors and partners.

        <p style="text-align: left;">After refining our initial narrative, we met with Nelli Morgulchik, a biotech angel
          investor and co-founder of future.bio, a syndicate of builders and investors at the intersection of
          computation and biology.
          <br><br>
          As an ex-VC at Hummingbird Ventures, Nelli provided us with targeted feedback on both our pitch deck from a
          biotech investor lens and outreach strategy. She advised us to separate our investor pitch deck from
          fundraising materials, removing the latter completely as it blurred our value proposition. She highlighted the
          importance of including a pricing slide backed by competitor analysis to demonstrate cost advantage. Nelli
          also encouraged us to make our roadmap more transparent, breaking down short-term milestones and long-term
          vision into clear, actionable stages, which helped us further refine our deck and later our Jamboree
          presentation.
          <br><br>
          Beyond strategic input, she introduced us to key industry contacts at Multus and Hoxton Farms, helping us
          secure upcoming stakeholder interviews. Following this meeting, we restructured our deck, added a dedicated
          pricing slide, clarified our differentiation, and shifted our messaging to center more clearly on cultivated
          meat rather than media narratives. Her input was instrumental in aligning our investor-facing materials with
          real-world expectations and setting the foundation for our next wave of strategic conversations.

        <p style="text-align: left;">At two different points of our journey, we consulted **Olivia Brown** from Imperial
          Enterprise Lab to strengthen the entrepreneurial side of our project. Olivia specializes in startup
          acceleration and market strategy, and her guidance helped us bridge the gap between scientific innovation and
          business development.
          <br><br>
          In our first meeting, early in the project, Olivia pushed us to think critically about our business edge. She
          asked us to define who our customers really are, how scalable our idea could be, and what branding choices
          would best convey our value to partners and investors. She highlighted the importance of market analysis and
          competitor mapping, and encouraged us to validate our assumptions by speaking directly with industry
          stakeholders.
          <br><br>
          To support this, she introduced us to a wide range of resources within Imperial and beyond, including the
          startup directory, Founder Slack, Hackspace, EIT Food, and the Food Student Research Network. These
          connections laid the foundation for our outreach and helped us test our positioning in the cultivated meat,
          media, and purification industries.
          <br><br>
          Later in our journey, Olivia worked with us again to refine our pitch. This time, her feedback focused on
          balance: ensuring that our presentation combined the rigor of science with the clarity of a strong business
          narrative. She urged us to broaden our framing beyond cultivated meat and highlight wider applications in
          vaccines and biomanufacturing, which positioned our work as a flexible platform technology rather than a
          single-industry bet. She also guided us through IP considerations and advised us on how best to engage with
          the Enterprise Lab’s Experts in Residence hub, offering access to over 100 specialists for targeted feedback.
          <br><br>
          Taken together, these two consultations reshaped our entrepreneurial approach. Olivia’s early guidance
          clarified our direction and outreach, while her later advice refined our communication and market positioning.

        <p style="text-align: left;">Dr. Pedro Lovatt Garcia is a Biotech Investment expert who played a key role in
          refining both the strategic direction and communication of Growf's pitch deck. With the cultivated meat
          industry facing significant challenges post-2022, such as rising interest rates, reduced venture funding, and
          an increase in acquisitions, he stressed the importance of adapting the narrative to address these shifts.
          Pedro encouraged the team to expand the focus of the K. phaffii platform, positioning it as a versatile tool
          for broader biomanufacturing applications, such as vaccine protein production. This reframing allowed the
          project to appeal to a wider range of industries and investors, especially those with more immediate needs.
          <br><br>
          His input led to important changes in the pitch deck, notably shifting from specific cost figures to broader
          performance metrics. Instead of quoting exact prices, Pedro recommended highlighting efficiency gains (e.g.,
          3x improvements), which provide a more credible and flexible narrative. He also advised revising technical
          terminology, using "protein secretion" to better convey the platform’s broader capabilities. In addition, he
          suggested removing speculative cost projections and focusing on efficiency data and potential savings to
          present a more grounded business case.
          <br><br>
          Pedro also guided the go-to-market strategy, recommending an initial focus on applications like vaccine
          manufacturing, where there’s clearer demand for protein expression tools. He emphasized the importance of
          identifying target customers and showcasing real or potential partnerships to strengthen traction. Finally,
          Pedro encouraged exploring the sale of strain IP as a short-term revenue model before developing proprietary
          growth factors. His contributions helped refine the project’s approach to both the market and investors,
          ensuring it was better aligned with the industry's current dynamics.

      <p style="text-align: left;">Meeting with Hugh Bowen, Senior Investor at SOSV, provided invaluable insights into
        how to refine both our pitch and broader strategy. The session offered a firsthand experience of presenting an
        early-stage biotech idea to a seasoned investor, allowing us to receive direct feedback on key aspects like
        vision, technical feasibility, and market potential. Hugh's feedback particularly challenged us to clarify the
        long-term impact of our project, especially in the context of food and synthetic biology.
        <br><br>
        One of the most significant takeaways was the importance of a clear, focused narrative. Hugh asked us to
        pinpoint exactly what we were offering: Is it the cultivated meat, the growth factors, or the engineered
        chassis? This forced us to re-evaluate our messaging and ultimately narrow our focus to growth factors,
        applied specifically to cultivated meat. This shift helped simplify our value proposition, making it more
        tangible and aligned with market needs.
        <br><br>
        Beyond refining our pitch, this exercise also taught us critical lessons in designing future stakeholder
        engagements. Whether interacting with policymakers, startup accelerators, or other potential investors, we
        learned how to position our project more effectively and communicate its value. The session underscored the
        need for a clear, cohesive story that resonates with different audiences, helping us refine both our approach
        to future pitches and how we position ourselves within the broader biotech ecosystem.
