        <div class="collapsible-content">


          <p style="text-align:left ;">

            We initially organized a meeting with Dr. Neidhardt, a member of the Bezos Centre for Sustainable Protein
            and
            regional mentor for the Good Food Institute, to discuss how we could frame our project with the goal of
            contributing to the field of alternative proteins.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Neidhardt highlighted the inefficient practices of traditional food production, such as the 8:1 calorie
            conversion ratio for chicken, and outlined current examples of sustainable proteins in the industry. She
            also
            highlighted the many regulatory burdens that the alternative protein industry faces today, which are
            limiting
            its real-world applications.
            <br><br>
            Based on Dr. Neidhardt’s initial meeting, we chose to focus on cultivated meat, a facet of alternative
            proteins
            that remains largely underexploited in industry, likely due to technical barriers that drive up costs. In
            particular, we chose to focus on researching into recombinant growth factor production, as it remains one of
            the
            primary cost barriers in the cultivated meat industry.
          </p>
          <div class="spacer"></div>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Our first meeting with Dr Konzock aimed to cover the range of possible microbial
            chassis we could choose from for our project. Oliver walked us through the design and transformation cycle
            for
            the yeast he was currently working on, Yarrowia lipolytica. The main takeaway from this was that the
            chassis’
            slow growth cycles and need for non-standard DNA parts would make it unfeasible at the iGEM timescale. A
            single DBTL cycle could take over a month, thus leaving us very little time for further work.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, we benefited from Dr. Konzock’s previous experience with iGEM, namely his work in wet lab and
            team leadership capacities at the Technische Universität Braunschweigm team in 2013 and 2014 respectively,
            as
            we gained valuable insight on the feasibility and appeal of our project from a former iGEMer’s point of
            view.
            He advised us to angle our project in a way that could easily be communicated to the wider public, even when
            significantly abstracted.
            <br><br>
            Following this conversation, we reached out to additional experts to investigate whether other yeast chassis
            like <i>Komagataella phaffii</i> would allow for a greater number of engineering cycles within the same
            timeframe.
            If feasible, this would significantly reduce our experimental risk.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Neidhardt and Dr. Konzock’s honest assessment gave us the clarity we needed in picking which chassis to
            prioritise, shaping a more time-resilient strategy for the wet lab component of our project. We onboarded
            them
            as advisors for our project.

          <p style="text-align: left;">
            Dr. Alex Van de Steen confirmed that <i>Pichia</i> transformation timelines can be compressed to under one
            month and, with optimisation, may approach the speed of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. However, he also
            emphasised that unless our project specifically required <i>Pichia’s</i> strengths, such as high volumetric
            protein yield, absence of self-inhibition, or superior secretion capacity, there was no inherent advantage
            in
            selecting it over faster or more extensively characterised organisms like <i>E. coli.</i>
            <br><br>
            Since our initial concept was to leverage secretion capabilities in growth factor production, this

        <div class="collapsible-content">

          <p style="text-align: left;"> In reaching out to Dr. Gasser we sought to obtain a perspective on the
            cutting-edge of different aspects that
            are being engineered to improve the chassis we are working on. Specifically, we wanted to inquire about
            metabolic engineering and degradation/stress pathways.
            <br><br>
            We firstly inquired about industry concerns regarding polymannose contamination in culture supernatant at
            high
            cell densities, which Dr. Gasser commented as not being a problem brought up by the industry so far. This
            was
            largely in line with our expectations, as the issue has only recently been highlighted in academia, though
            unlocking gains through streamlined metabolism was confirmed as an avenue of interest for greater yields.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Gasser remarked that, especially for producing heterologous proteins with several disulfide bonds, there
            are bottlenecks present in folding, which likely introduce cell lysis at worst or at best ER-associated
            degradation, leading to suboptimal titers. It was also mentioned that this could be ameliorated at times by
            overexpressing UPR proteins or co-expressing chaperones, but we decided not to pursue this avenue due to a
            recorded dependence on combinatorial experimentation, resulting in a less generalisable contribution and
            large
            experimental footprint.
            <br><br>
            When we inquired about fermentation techniques, Dr. Gasser mentioned that while fed-batch fermentation with
            methanol is currently the most commonly used method with <i>K. phaffii</i> in industry, we may see more
            continuous
            fermentation methods with other feedstocks, such as glucose, become more common in the future. Although we
            had
            no time to implement this feedback into our project design, this gave us new insight from the perspective of
            an expert with perspectives from both academia and industry on the future of <i>K. phaffii</i> precision
            fermentation.
            <br><br>
            Other extrinsic drivers to push down production costs of high PTM proteins in <i>K. Phaffii</i> also became
            a
            topic
            of discussion, as grants to produce $10/kg monoclonal antibodies are being issued through an initiative by
            the
            Bill and Melinda Gates foundation that Dr. Gasser mentioned. This avenue inspired us to think more about
            other
            stakeholders that would benefit from a chassis better at producing highly complex proteins.

        <div class="collapsible-content">

          <p style="text-align: left;">
            We reached out to Dr. Prudence regarding his recent experience as senior scientist at Better Dairy, a
            London-based company focused on precision fermentation for dairy products including cheese, yogurt, and ice
            cream.
            <br><br>
            Our meeting with Dr. Prudence about yeast strain engineering challenges in industry led to a productive
            discussion about the obstacles startups face when developing commercial strains.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Prudence highlighted a significant roadblock: the restrictive and crowded IP landscape surrounding
            industrially relevant yeast. This IP is typically held by a few contract manufacturers, putting startups
            that
            cannot afford licensing at a competitive disadvantage. An aspect of this is that many well-characterised
            strains are constrained by commercial licensing, underscoring that budding businesses could stand to benefit
            greatly from more open-license yeasts.
            <br><br>
            The conversation then shifted to startup-specific challenges, with Dr. Prudence describing how difficult it
            is
            to resolve complex strain issues while operating on venture capital funding timelines. Specifically, Dr.
            Prudence explained that VC expectations for alternative protein companies to generate revenue while still
            scaling up operations widens the "valley of death." He emphasized the importance of communicating investment
            opportunities attractively while setting realistic milestones.
            <br><br>
            He recommended developing the revenue-generating aspects of the technology within a university setting
            before
            spinning out as a startup.
            <br><br>
            The general challenge of downstream processing costs for startups were raised again, making it nearly
            impossible to scale alternative protein products in the UK environment, due to a lack of suitable
            facilities.

          <p style="text-align: left;">
            Our focus was understanding the key challenges in industrial <i>K. phaffii</i> applications and the broad
            external perception of a media company catering towards cultured meat cultivation.
            <br><br>
            Reka shared her company’s experience on working with the growth factors fundamental to our project. Through
            her industry insider viewpoint, we obtained necessary validation of IGF-1, EGF, and HGF being widely
            demanded in cultivated meat. She stated that while IGF-1 and EGF, being smaller growth factors, were
            relatively easy to verify in <i>K. phaffii</i>, larger growth factors such as HGF posed a significant
            challenge,
            as it has a highly complex shape and is heavily cleaved. She also suggested FGF2, one of the cheapest and
            easiest to produce, as another potential growth factor of interest.
            <br><br>
            Moreover, Reka stated that Multus has engineered several of their growth factors for better dose-response
            properties, serving as an example of a different approach to improving growth factor economics in cultured
            meat. However, we evaluated that the relative impact our project could have was not meaningfully enhanced by
            performing such protein engineering on growth factors, particularly not given our existing timeline
            challenges.
            <br><br>
            The second part of our conversation was centered around public and industry opinion. Reka emphasized an
            attention shift towards media composition and sourcing, especially to sustainable and “waste” carbon
            sources, within the industry. On the other hand, she also pointed out that the public narrative is shifting
            and has resulted in declining end-consumer enthusiasm and waning investor interest. We reconciled these as
            being signs of a more grounded and less optimistic industry atmosphere adjusting to investor confidence in
            the sector.
            <br><br>
            Reka also connected us to Hoxton Farms and Catherine from Qkine, extending our network in the cultivated
            meat space and helping us situate our work within the wider ecosystem.

          <p style="text-align: left;">
            Initially, we contacted Jason to discuss our rationale for CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA design and receive holistic
            feedback from someone deeply knowledgeable in the field. At this point, we had identified initial gene
            targets
            and tried to come up with sgRNA designs on our own with the primary goal of modifying the consensus Kozak
            sequences of the gene targets to regulate their expression levels. We scrapped our plans of multiplexing
            CRISPR-Cas9 edits after Jason raised concerns on metabolic burden and cell viability.
            <br><br>
            Through our feedback sessions, we settled on using CRISPR-Cas9 to insert a copy of one of our genes of
            interest with an inducible promoter instead of engineering the Kozak consensus sequence. We also realized
            that
            using a delta-Ku70 strain of <i>K. phaffii</i> and targeting our sgRNAs close to the start or stop codons
            would
            allow leveraging CRISPR-Cas9 fully through homologous recombination for our desired modifications. Jason
            kindly offered to share some of such a strain with us, and it was subsequently utilised as the target of all
            our CRISPR experiments.
            <br><br>
            Our discussions continued into experimental design and workflow for the CRISPR experiments. He introduced us
            to electroporation, a technique none of us had experience with. We leveraged this to come up with a more
            robust transformation strategy, along with better primer design for verifying plasmid integration.
            <br><br>
            Dr Yu's advice was pivotal throughout the project and he since kindly accepted to be onboarded as a formal
            advisor for our iGEM project.

          <p style="text-align: left;">From his experience pivoting away from <italic>K. phaffii</italic>-based growth
            factor production, Brandon highlighted the challenges
            of an overcrowded landscape, CMO (Contract Manufacturing Organization) dependencies, and patent
            restrictions,
            encouraging us to frame our proof-of-concept around reduced sugar production rather than immediate growth
            factor purification.
            <br><br>
            He also gave us plenty of advice for working with <italic>K. phaffii</italic>. He recommended beginning with
            the wild type
            CBS 7435 strain, using small constructs with ~80 ng DNA input, and screening over 100 clones via 96-well
            plates with dot blots for validation. We deemed this infeasible at iGEM scales and did not implement this
            for
            our project. He additionally shared practical troubleshooting tips, including monitoring pellet color and
            smell for contaminants, and using dual antibiotic selection.
            <br><br>
            For CRISPR design, Brandon advised manually validating primers against the <italic>K. phaffii</italic>
            genome using NCBI
            files, ordering multiple primer sets, and sequencing bands when gels are inconclusive. He recommended
            specific
            software for codon optimization and suggested ordering multiple optimized variants to compare expression.
            <br><br>
            In terms of targets, he advised us to prioritize EGF and IGF due to their higher stability. Brandon raised
            some concerns against our plan to focus on HGF production, since the 3-balls-on-a-chain structure is prone
            to
            cleavage. He suggested producing FGF2, a smaller, more stable protein. Consequently, we introduced FGF2 as a
            more feasible target protein alongside HGF for confirmation of our rPOI expression workflow.

            To validate the method, he recommended creating a synthetic dataset with simple ODE outputs and Gaussian
            noise
            inputs before moving to more complex equations. Heteroscedastic noise should only be introduced and tested
            after sufficient model accuracy is confirmed with homoscedastic noise.
            <br><br>
            Regarding new tools, Ruben highlighted the PyMC library for Bayesian interference, which could be used to
            isolate the experimentally derived variables and reinsert them back into the model. This was tested as part
            of
            the optimisation stack.
            <br><br>
            As a response to our proposed experimental design, he stressed ensuring that cell cultures remain in the log
            growth phase, since overcrowding inherently changes the metabolic state of a cell. Finally, he provided key
            literature references, which all helped us to build our dry lab components.

            Dr. Bultelle’s initial advice concerned repeatability and experimental variance. We were encouraged to vary
            stimulus and environmental properties while avoiding introduction of genetic variation. Introduced inducer
            concentration accuracy was raised as a significant issue when working with very small volumes. This led us

        <div class="collapsible-content">


          <p style="text-align: left;">
            The most striking takeaway from our conversation was the seemingly **large amount of misconceptions**
            surrounding best practice in biomanufacturing that persist in academia, such as specific titre quantities or
            comparative importance of chassis engineering vs downstream processing. Notably, there has been
            comparatively
            low interest from researchers in downstream processing improvements as opposed to yield-centric strain
            engineering. Largely, this seeming lack of information was attributed to differences in funding structures
            and
            a lack of incentives to share achievements from industry. As Mr. Warner pointed out, intellectual property
            and
            the pursuit of a competitive edge has allowed many industry-engineered strains to **far surpass the current
            best estimates in academia.**
            <br><br>
            This led us to critically examine a limitation of our project: the difficulty in benchmarking our strain
            engineering quantitatively, since the most comparative data are likely not publicly available. Consequently
            we
            constrained our focus more on our unique improvement avenues, like previously under-investigated impurities,
            rather than improving widely accepted performance objectives like space-time yield.
            <br><br>
            Mr. Warner expressed that a large amount of businesses in the novel foods sector likely **fail due to blind
            spots in industrial contexts**, justifying our contact with corporate bioprocessing experts. A common issue
            was focus on rPOI expression improvement taking attention away from needed and viable methods of
            purification.
            Drawing on experience, he flagged that there were likely currently no insurmountable hurdles to producing
            large volumes of growth factors in methanol-fed *K. phaffii*. Interestingly, **this directly contradicted
            some
            input we had received previously** about fundamental upstream issues blocking the viability of growth factor
            production at scale to meet demands of the cultivated meat industry.
            <br><br>
            It also partially confirmed our hypothesis that barriers in downstream processing, like lysis or impurities,
            would be a more useful objective to tackle. Based on Mr. Warner's recommendation, we **contacted Blake Byrne
            and Dr. Christian Schuster at Magnify Bio** which revealed specific downstream purification challenges to
            us.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, he emphasised that the existing cleanroom standards followed by most bioproduction plants are
            prohibitively expensive for scaling up food-grade protein production, highlighting the need for more
            large-scale facilities specifically designed for this purpose.
            <br><br>
            Seed-scale production companies of lower-cost growth factors for cultivated meat were driven by what Mr
            Warner
            called a “chicken and egg problem” that is fuelled by market uncertainty. In essence, **synthetic meat
            companies seem not to scale due to a lack of affordable growth factors, while the lack of an active market
            discourages development in food-grade growth factor production.** Our takeaway was that a successful
            cultured
            meat startup needs to have strong founding partnerships with suppliers and realistic demand forecasts to
            succeed.
            <br><br>
            While we couldn't address market structure issues through strain engineering alone, this conversation
            clarified why engaging with established contract manufacturers was more valuable than focusing exclusively

          industrial protein manufacturing innovation in <i>K. phaffii</i>, while planning our mini jamboree. We found
          an

            Our cell wall and mannose pathway targeting was validated as a potential blind spot in engineering of the
            Chassis, given the long running history of trHoc1 strains with little iteration. Dr. Sprent agreed on the
            essentiality of downstream processing efficiency gains, as well as the room for improvement present there.
            As
            this is the first year of <i>K. phaffii</i> being greenlit as a Chassis, we planned a collaboration to
            publish
            the
            whole genome sequence of a strain lacking commercial licensing issues or restrictions. This is part of an
            effort spearheaded by Dr. Sprent named PhaffiiNet, which aims to avoid the commercial red tape around <i>K.
              phaffii</i> strains that Dr. Sprent ran into commercial licensing limitations with.
            <br><br>
            He agreed to transfer the strain to us for validation purposes and thus support the development of <i>K.
              phaffii</i> as a commercial strain within iGEM.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Sprent generously offered us a 2L bioreactor to run a trial fermentation in, which would yield more
            industrially relevant results than shake flask cultures.
            <br><br>
            He also flagged issues of using CRISPR for commercial and industrial use cases due to licensing issues, and
            proposed the alternative of using a split marker double-crossover with a floxed episomal resistance marker.
            It
            was concluded that we could emulate our edits using this method if commercialisation was our goal, though by
            this point the strategy was not feasible as we had already followed through with our CRISPR recombination
            engineering.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, Dr. Sprent directed us towards several industry experts in <i>K. phaffii</i> manufacturing at
            scale,
            including Mark Warner and Blake Byrne, who we later reached out to.

        <div class="collapsible-content">



          <p style="text-align: left;">
            Dr. Carballo Pacheco has helped us to understand the perspective of a cultivation-focused company,
            furthering
            our understanding of the demand-side concerns in the growth factor market. Key challenges to expansion were
            described as transition from research to commercial scale, expensive validation studies for stirred tank
            bioreactors, and lack of established market for bulk growth factors. Although growth factors are available
            on
            the milligram scale, finding suppliers that would produce kilogram-scale food-grade and low-cost growth
            factors remains an unsolved issue. Martin has also directed us towards a report from the
            Good Food Institute [1], which outlines that growth factors can contribute up to 90% of media cost.
            <br><br>
            This has confirmed our initial focus on growth factors for synthetic meat, but more importantly showed that
            projects financial success will be determined by matching a market need. This was further emphasized by
            Martin’s advice to partner with real world companies for validation of real world applications.
            <br><br>
            We also discussed Hoxton’s use of specific data science methods, namely Bayesian optimization, for rapid,
            small-scale media testing before scaling to pilot reactors. Specifically, the utility of transfer learning
            in
            Bayesian optimization for faster and lower experimental footprint scale-up optimization was confirmed. It
            validated our decision to a similar computational tools in our modelling workflow.
            <br><br>
            Finally, Martin was one of the key speakers for our Food Tech panel during the Mini Jamboree we hosted at
            Imperial College London. He delivered a well-received presentation about the science and hard work that
            makes
            cultivated pork fat a reality of today rather a dream of tomorrow. He also generously provided another round
            of feedback for our preliminary project pitch at the mini jamboree.

            Konstantin confirmed that <italic>K. phaffii</italic> is a suitable chassis for food applications that
            require complex
            proteins but not necessarily humanised glycosylation. He explained that most growth factors fall below 1000
            amino acids, making purification more manageable, and that post-translational modifications are less
            critical
            in food than in therapeutic settings.
            <br><br>
            The consultation confirmed our choice of using His-tag affinity chromatography to purify and quantify our
            recombinant proteins, as we were told to avoid size exclusion chromatography due to some inefficiencies at
            large scale.
            <br><br>
            He also recommended reverse-phase chromatography as a low-cost alternative, especially for small, refoldable
            proteins. Konstantin further provided insight into realistic yields (0.5 g/L in <italic>K. phaffii</italic>)
            and scale-up
            strategies, advocating for 1000L single-use bioreactors and ISO 7 food-grade facilities, which reduce
            sterility and QA costs compared to pharmaceutical production.

            Her journey highlighted both the promise and the pitfalls of the cultivated
            meat industry: despite developing a high-yield, continuous adherent cell manufacturing process and securing
            strong pharma trial partners, her team faced declining investment in cellular agriculture and long decision
            timelines after pivoting towards pharma, leading to the company’s closure. Martina emphasized the harsh
            realities of the current investment climate, overpromising by cultivated meat companies, waning investor
            confidence, and the particular difficulty of raising funds for enabling technologies rather than
            consumer-facing products. From this, she advised us to carefully balance diversification with focus, explore
            quicker market entry points, and prioritize revenue generation strategies such as non-dilutive funding and
            B2B-focused investors. Most importantly, she encouraged us to simplify our narrative for non-technical
            stakeholders and to critically evaluate the implementation challenges of our chosen market. Her candid
            reflections offered us invaluable perspective on both strategic pitfalls and resilience in biotech

            With deep storytelling expertise gained during her time at McKinsey and later at Lightspeed, Victoria helped
            us move beyond academic framing and shape a compelling, investor-ready story with pitch-perfect slides. She
            guided us to structure the deck as a high-level narrative, moving from a bold problem statement to a
            visionary
            solution and strategic edge, all while emphasising visual clarity. We discussed how to simplify technical
            language without losing depth, reorder slides for greater impact, and use whitespace and pacing to hold
            attention. Her slide-by-slide feedback led us to rebuild our deck with thematic titles, more intuitive
            design,
            and a clearer value proposition for external partners.
            <br><br>
            The two meetings held with her fundamentally shifted our communication strategy, helping us transition from

            As an ex-VC at Hummingbird Ventures, Nelli provided us with targeted feedback on both our pitch deck from a
            biotech investor lens and outreach strategy. She advised us to separate our investor pitch deck from
            fundraising materials, removing the latter completely as it blurred our value proposition. She highlighted
            the
            importance of including a pricing slide backed by competitor analysis to demonstrate cost advantage. Nelli
            also encouraged us to make our roadmap more transparent, breaking down short-term milestones and long-term
            vision into clear, actionable stages, which helped us further refine our deck and later our Jamboree
            presentation.

            pricing slide, clarified our differentiation, and shifted our messaging to center more clearly on cultivated

            real-world expectations and setting the foundation for our next wave of strategic conversations.

        <p style="text-align: left;">At two different points of our journey, we consulted Olivia Brown from
          Imperial
          Enterprise Lab to strengthen the entrepreneurial side of our project. Olivia specializes in startup
          acceleration and market strategy, and her guidance helped us bridge the gap between scientific innovation
          and
          business development.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">
            In our first meeting, early in the project, Olivia pushed us to think critically about our business edge.
            She
            asked us to define who our customers really are, how scalable our idea could be, and what branding choices
            would best convey our value to partners and investors. She highlighted the importance of market analysis and
            competitor mapping, and encouraged us to validate our assumptions by speaking directly with industry
            stakeholders.
            <br><br>
            To support this, she introduced us to a wide range of resources within Imperial and beyond, including the
            startup directory, Founder Slack, Hackspace, EIT Food, and the Food Student Research Network. These
            connections laid the foundation for our outreach and helped us test our positioning in the cultivated meat,
            media, and purification industries.
            <br><br>
            Later in our journey, Olivia worked with us again to refine our pitch. This time, her feedback focused on
            balance: ensuring that our presentation combined the rigor of science with the clarity of a strong business
            narrative. She urged us to broaden our framing beyond cultivated meat and highlight wider applications in
            vaccines and biomanufacturing, which positioned our work as a flexible platform technology rather than a
            single-industry bet. She also guided us through IP considerations and advised us on how best to engage with
            the Enterprise Lab’s Experts in Residence hub, offering access to over 100 specialists for targeted
            feedback.
            <br><br>
            Taken together, these two consultations reshaped our entrepreneurial approach. Olivia’s early guidance
            clarified our direction and outreach, while her later advice refined our communication and market
            positioning.

        <p style="text-align: left;">As students working on a project in a patent-heavy industry, we faced uncertainty
          around the legal pathways to bring our idea to market. We were constrained by both university research rules
          and international student visa laws, and unsure whether patents or trade secrets would be the most effective
          route.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">
            During our consultation with Katie Moruzzi, Imperial Expert-in-Residence and Associate at Briffa -
            Intellectual Property Lawyers, we learned about the five main categories of IP protection: trademarks,
            copyright, registered designs, patents, and confidential know-how. We also discussed the trade-offs between
            filing patents and relying on trade secrets. Patents can provide strong protection but are costly (around
            £5,000 per country), require public disclosure, and must be expanded internationally within a strict 6-month
            window. Trade secrets, by contrast, avoid disclosure and costs, but only work if the invention cannot be
            easily reverse-engineered.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, as yeast engineering is highly patented, we have to confirm novelty and freedom-to-operate
            before filing. We were advised to perform prior searches, check our names and logos against UK Companies
            House
            and IPO databases, and speak with SynBio-specialist patent attorneys, which we have immediately taken upon
            doing.
            <br><br>
            Another key complication we would encounter is company formation: as international students, we cannot
            immediately incorporate in the UK, which risks fragmenting ownership if IP is held individually, hence we
            had
            to look into alternative ways of incorporation.

          <p style="text-align: left;">She briefed us on patentability
            criteria, specifically how unique gene knockout combinations could be patentable if they produce unexpected
            synergistic effects. We also discussed patenting practices across different jurisdictions, including the US,
            UK, and China. She recommended the European Patent Office as our primary patenting venue because it's more
            favorable than the US, particularly due to its narrower prior art rules. However, the filing timeline was
            identified as a major barrier: any patent application would need to be submitted well before iGEM deadlines,
            requiring a UK priority filing within days. While minimal preliminary data would suffice for an initial
            filing, the uncertainty around ownership with Imperial College complicated matters further, as Imperial
            could
            either retain ownership and cover costs, disclaim ownership and leave costs to us, or negotiate shared
            ownership. After considering these factors, and staying aligned with our commitment to open science, we
            decided not to pursue patent protection, ensuring our work remains accessible to future iGEM teams while
            focusing on immediate project impact.

          <p style="text-align: left;"> With the cultivated meat
            industry facing significant challenges post-2022, such as rising interest rates, reduced venture funding,
            and
            an increase in acquisitions, he stressed the importance of adapting the narrative to address these shifts.
            Pedro encouraged the team to expand the focus of the K. phaffii platform, positioning it as a versatile tool
            for broader biomanufacturing applications, such as vaccine protein production. This reframing allowed the
            project to appeal to a wider range of industries and investors, especially those with more immediate needs.
            <br><br>
            His input led to important changes in the pitch deck, notably shifting from specific cost figures to broader
            performance metrics. Instead of quoting exact prices, Pedro recommended highlighting efficiency gains (e.g.,
            3x improvements), which provide a more credible and flexible narrative. He also advised revising technical
            terminology, using "protein secretion" to better convey the platform’s broader capabilities. In addition, he
            suggested removing speculative cost projections and focusing on efficiency data and potential savings to
            present a more grounded business case.
            <br><br>
            Pedro also guided the go-to-market strategy, recommending an initial focus on applications like vaccine
            manufacturing, where there’s clearer demand for protein expression tools. He emphasized the importance of
            identifying target customers and showcasing real or potential partnerships to strengthen traction. Finally,
            Pedro encouraged exploring the sale of strain IP as a short-term revenue model before developing proprietary
            growth factors. His contributions helped refine the project’s approach to both the market and investors,
            ensuring it was better aligned with the industry's current dynamics.

          <p style="text-align: left;">The session offered a firsthand experience of presenting an
            early-stage biotech idea to a seasoned investor, allowing us to receive direct feedback on key aspects like
            vision, technical feasibility, and market potential. Hugh's feedback particularly challenged us to clarify
            the
            long-term impact of our project, especially in the context of food and synthetic biology.
            <br><br>
            One of the most significant takeaways was the importance of a clear, focused narrative. Hugh asked us to
            pinpoint exactly what we were offering: Is it the cultivated meat, the growth factors, or the engineered
            chassis? This forced us to re-evaluate our messaging and ultimately narrow our focus to growth factors,
            applied specifically to cultivated meat. This shift helped simplify our value proposition, making it more
            tangible and aligned with market needs.
            <br><br>
            Beyond refining our pitch, this exercise also taught us critical lessons in designing future stakeholder
            engagements. Whether interacting with policymakers, startup accelerators, or other potential investors, we
            learned how to position our project more effectively and communicate its value. The session underscored the
            need for a clear, cohesive story that resonates with different audiences, helping us refine both our
            approach
            to future pitches and how we position ourselves within the broader biotech ecosystem.
